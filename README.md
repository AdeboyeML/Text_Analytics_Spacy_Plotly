# Text_Analytics_Spacy_Plotly


**The aim of this text analytics project is to analyse a storybook or novel through extracting out the characters, their dialogue, words/verbs used them and also to check the locations and time occurences mentioned in the novel.**


### Objectives:

- Extract out the major characters, time occurences and geopolitical locations mentioned in the Novel.

- Check the Gender distribution based on the characters in the Novel
- Extract out sentences where characters are the "Subject" and the corresponding "action verbs" used by them

### Steps Ahead:
- Convert PDF Book(.pdf) to Text Format (.txt)
- Data Cleaning with Regex (Regular Expression)
- Entity Extraction with Spacy
- Data Visualization with Plotly:
   - Character, Geopolitical and Time occurence Visualizations
   - Gender Distribution charts
   - Character's Appearances Visualizations
- Dependency parsing -- to extract sentences where characters are the "Subject" of Sentences
. Character's action visualization
