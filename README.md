# Text(Book/Novel)_Analytics_Spacy_Plotly

### Highly Recommended: The graphs/plots in the notebook can be viewed using this link: 

- **Fight Club Novel Analytics [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AdeboyeML/Text_Analytics_Spacy_Plotly/blob/054b26e1c0f64fc8f5cb21bc90e113c1fc1ed2ed/FightClub_Novel_Analytics.ipynb),**

- **Martian Novel Analytics [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AdeboyeML/Text_Analytics_Spacy_Plotly/blob/054b26e1c0f64fc8f5cb21bc90e113c1fc1ed2ed/Martian_Novel_Analytics.ipynb),**

This is because the plotly graphs cannot be viewed in github.

**The aim of this text analytics project is to analyse a storybook or novel through extracting out the characters, their dialogue, words/verbs used them and also to check the locations and time occurences mentioned in the novel.**


### Objectives:

- Extract out the major characters, time occurences and geopolitical locations mentioned in the Novel.
- Extract out the interaction between the top characters if any, i.e. check if two characters appear in the same sentences
- Check the Gender distribution based on the characters in the Novel
- Extract out sentences where characters are the "Subject" and the corresponding "action verbs" used by them

### Steps Ahead:
- Convert PDF Book(.pdf) to Text Format (.txt)
- Data Cleaning with Regex (Regular Expression)
- Entity Extraction with Spacy
- Data Visualization with Plotly:
   - Character, Geopolitical and Time occurence Visualizations
   - Gender Distribution charts
   - Character's Appearances Visualizations
- Dependency parsing -- to extract sentences where characters are the "Subject" of Sentences
. Character's action visualization

### ***Tools utilized: Python libraries:  Spacy, NLTK, Ploty, Seaborn, Regex***

### ***Note: All the codes are ran from the following python modules: pdf_to_txt.py, txt_extract.py, gender.py, text_plots.py, subj.py***
