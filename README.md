# Text_Analytics_Spacy_Plotly...


**The aim of this text analytics project is to analyse a storybook or novel through extracting out the characters, their dialogue, words/verbs used by them and also to check the locations and time occurences mentioned in the novel.**


### Highly Recommended: The graphs/plots in the notebook can be viewed using this link (Books/Novels Analysed): 

- **The Godfather Novel Analytics [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AdeboyeML/Text_Analytics_Spacy_Plotly/blob/5fc5f3ad8d3ec80d4ac5226e28b60156d5da42ee/The_Godfather_Novel_Analytics.ipynb),**

- **Silence of the Lambs Novel Analytics [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AdeboyeML/Text_Analytics_Spacy_Plotly/blob/5fc5f3ad8d3ec80d4ac5226e28b60156d5da42ee/Silence%20of%20the%20Lambs_Novel_Analytics.ipynb),**

- **The Big Short Novel Analytics [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AdeboyeML/Text_Analytics_Spacy_Plotly/blob/5fc5f3ad8d3ec80d4ac5226e28b60156d5da42ee/The_Big%20Short_Novel_Analytics.ipynb),**

- **Fight Club Novel Analytics [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AdeboyeML/Text_Analytics_Spacy_Plotly/blob/054b26e1c0f64fc8f5cb21bc90e113c1fc1ed2ed/FightClub_Novel_Analytics.ipynb),**

- **Martian Novel Analytics [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AdeboyeML/Text_Analytics_Spacy_Plotly/blob/054b26e1c0f64fc8f5cb21bc90e113c1fc1ed2ed/Martian_Novel_Analytics.ipynb),**


This is because the plotly graphs cannot be viewed in github.



### Objectives:

- Extract out the major characters, time occurences and geopolitical locations mentioned in the Novel.
- Extract out the interaction between the top characters if any, i.e. check if two characters appear in the same sentences
- Check the Gender distribution based on the characters in the Novel
- Extract out sentences where characters are the "Subject" and the corresponding "action verbs" used by them

### Steps Ahead:
- Convert PDF Book(.pdf) to Text Format (.txt)
- Data Cleaning with Regex (Regular Expression)
- Entity Extraction with Spacy
- Data Visualization with Plotly:
   - Character, Geopolitical and Time occurence Visualizations
   - Gender Distribution charts
   - Character's Appearances Visualizations
- Dependency parsing -- to extract sentences where characters are the "Subject" of Sentences
. Character's action visualization

### ***Tools utilized: Python libraries:  Spacy, NLTK, Ploty, Seaborn, Regex***

### ***Note: All the codes are ran from the following python modules: `pdf_to_txt.py`, `txt_extract.py`, `bigsort_txtextract.py`, `gender.py`, `text_plots.py`, `subj.py`***
