JACK (V.O.)

People were always asking me, did I
know Tyler Durden.

FADE IN:

INT. SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH-RISE - NIGHT

TYLER has the barrel of a HANDGUN lodged in JACK'S MOUTH. 
They struggle intensely.

They are both around 30; Tyler is blond, handsome, eyes
burning with frightening intensity; and JACK, brunette, is
appealing in a dry sort of way.  They are both sweating and
disheveled; Jack seems to be losing his will to fight.

TYLER

We won't really die.  We'll be
immortal.

oor -- ee-ee --uh -- aa-i --

JACK

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.

Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

You're thinking of vampires.

JACK (still distorted) (CONT'D)

Jack tries to get the gun.  Tyler keeps control.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

With my tongue, I can feel the
silencer holes drilled into the barrel
of the gun.  Most of the noise a
gunshot makes is expanding gases.  I
totally forgot about Tyler's whole
murder-suicide thing for a second
and I wondered how clean the gun
barrel was.

Tyler checks his watch.

Three minutes.

TYLER

Jack turns so that he can see down -- 71 STORIES.

JACK (V.O.)

The building we're standing won't be
here in three minutes.

(MORE)

2.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

You take a 98-percent concentration
of fuming nitric acid and add three
times as much sulfuric in a bathtub
full of ice.  Then, glycerin drop-by-
drop.  Nitroglycerin.  I know this
because Tyler knows this.

Jack manages to SHOVE Tyler away.  Then, he leaps onto him
and they fall onto a table, then roll off onto the floor. 
The gun falls and slides.  They wrestle with each other,
then dash for the gun.  Tyler gets there first and grabs the
gun.  DURING THE ABOVE:

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The Demolitions Committee of Project
Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns
of this building with blasting
gelatin.  The primary charge will
blow the base charge, and this spot
Tyler and I are standing on will be
a point in the sky.

Tyler drags Jack back to the glass wall and forces him to
look out at the city skyline.

This is our world now.  Two minutes.

TYLER

JACK (V.O.)

Two minutes to go and I'm wondering
how I got here.

MOVE IN ON JACK'S FACE.

SLOWLY PULL BACK from Jack's face.  It's pressed against TWO
LARGE BREASTS that belong to ... BOB, a big moose of a man,
around 35 years old.  Jack is engulfed by Bob's arms in an
embrace.  Bob weeps openly.

His shoulders inhale themselves up in a long draw, then drop,
drop, drop in jerking sobs.  Jack gives Bob some squeezes in
return, but his face is stone.

Bob had bitch tits.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

PULL BACK TO WIDE ON

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

All the men are paired off, hugging each other, talking in
emotional tones.  Some pairs lean forward, heads pressed ear-
to-ear, the way wrestlers stand, locked.  Near the door a
temporary sign on a stand:

"REMAINING MEN TOGETHER".

3.

JACK (V.O.)

This was a support group for men
with testicular cancer.  The big
moosie slobbering all over me was
Bob.

BOB

I owned my own gym.  I did product
endorsements.

You were a six-time champion.

JACK

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Bob, the big cheesebread.  Always
told me his life story.

We're still men.

BOB

JACK

Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we
are.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Bob cried.  Six months ago, his
testicles were removed.  Then hormone
therapy.  He developed bitch tits
because his testosterone was too
high and his body upped the estrogen. 
That was where my head fit -- into
his sweating tits that hang enormous,
the way we think of God's as big.

Bob hugs tighter, then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes.

BOB

Maybe it's just seminoma.  With
seminoma, you have a hundred percent
survival rate.

The Leader steps forward and signals everyone.

Okay.  Group hug.

LEADER

Everyone converges into a cluster with arms thrown around
shoulders, making a big mass of sobbing, smiling goodwill.

JACK (V.O.)

No.  Wait.  Back up.  Let me start
earlier.

INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.  He hears VOICES
from beyond the wall.  A FLY buzzes over his face.

4.

He swats at it, missing.

For six months.  I couldn't sleep.

JACK (V.O.)

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Jack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before the Doctor, who
studies him with bemusement.

No, you can't die of insomnia.

DOCTOR

JACK

Maybe I already died.  Look at my
face.

You need to lighten up.

DOCTOR

Can you give me something?

JACK

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Little red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-
red Seconals.

DOCTOR (overlapping w/ above)

You need healthy, natural sleep. 
Chew valerian root and get more
exercise.

The Doctor ushers Jack to the door.  They step into the

INT. HALLWAY

Where the Doctor starts moving away from Jack, picking up a
chart on a door.

I'm in pain.

JACK

DOCTOR

(facetious)

You want to see pain?  Swing by Meyer
High on a Tuesday night and see the
guys with testicular cancer.

The Doctor moves into the other room.  Jack stares after him
somberly.

MOVE IN ON JACK'S FACE.

PULL BACK TO WIDE ON:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

Jack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all
listening to a group member speak at a lectern.  The speaker
has death-white skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying.

5.

SPEAKER

I ... wanted to have three kids. 
Two boys and a girl.  Mindy wanted
two girls and one boy.  We never
agreed on anything.

The Speaker cracks a sad smile.  Some men chuckle, happy to
lighten the mood.

SPEAKER (CONT'D)

Well ... she had her first girl a
month ago ... with her new husband.

Thank God, because she deserves ...

The speaker breaks down and WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY.  Jack is
riveted.  He

barely breathes.  CUT TO:

INT. GYM - LATER

A Leader herds people into pairing-off.

Find a partner.

LEADER

Bob starts toward Jack, shuffling his feet.  Jack watches
him, still moved by his experience, face full of intense
empathy.

JACK (V.O.)

The big moosie, his eyes already
shrink-wrapped in tears.  Knees
together, invisible steps.

Bob takes Jack into an embrace.

He pancaked down on top of me.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

BOB

Two grown kids ... and they won't
return my calls.

JACK (V.O.)

Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big rubbery one.

6.

Jack's face is rapt and sincere.  Bob stops talking and breaks
into sobbing, putting his head down on Jack's shoulder and
completely covering Jack's face.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Then, I was lost in oblivion -- dark
and silent and complete.

Jack's body begins to jerk in sobs.  He tightens his arms
around Bob.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

This was freedom.  Losing all hope
was freedom.

Jack pulls back from Bob.  On Bob's chest, there's a WET
MASK of Jack's face from how he looked weeping.

Babies don't sleep this well.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

INT. JACKS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jack lies sound asleep.

I became addicted.

JACK (V.O.)

INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

Jack moves into a "group hug" of sickly people, men and women. 
In view is a sign by the door "Free and Clear".

JACK (V.O.)

I felt more alive than I've ever
felt.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHT

Jack pulls back from a group hug of more sickly people. 
They pair-off.

Jack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN.  He gingerly
takes her in his arms, pats her back.  He begins to cry along
with her.  In view is a sign by the door:  "Onward and
Upward".

JACK (V.O.)

If I didn't say anything, people
assumed the worst.  They cried harder.
I cried harder.

INT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

Jack is in an embrace with a YOUNG MAN.  They are both
weeping.

7.

JACK (V.O.)

I wasn't really dying.  I wasn't
host to cancer or parasites; no, I
was the warm little center that the
life of this world crowded around.

INT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone settles in their seats and a Leader takes the
microphone.

LEADER

Okay, everyone, close your eyes. 
Imagine your pain as a white ball of
healing light.  Go down your secret
path to your cave and join up with
your power animal.

EXT. ENTRANCE OF CAVE (JACK'S IMAGINATION)

Jack walks up to the entrance and out comes a PENGUIN.  The
penguin looks at him, smiles.

Slide.

PENGUIN

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Jack walks out of a doorway, saying goodbye to people.  He
walks down the sidewalk, his face shining with peace.

JACK (V.O.)

Every evening I died and every evening
I was born.  Resurrected.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - *RESUMING*

Jack still hanging in an embrace with Bob.

JACK (V.O.)

Bob loved me because he thought my
testicles were removed, too.  Being
there, my face against his tits,
getting ready to cry -- this was my
vacation.

MARLA SINGER enters.  She has short matte black hair and
big, dark eyes like a character from Japanese animation.

This is cancer, right?

MARLA

She raises a cigarette to her lips.  The men gape at her,
dumbfounded.

And *she* ruined everything.

JACK (V.O.)

8.

CUT TO:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER

Everyone paired-off.  MOVE THROUGH ROOM  and catch snippets
of intimate, painful CONVERSATION.

FIND JACK'S FACE as it stares, over Bob's shoulder, eyes
full of deep hostility.

Liar.  Faker.  Liar.

JACK (V.O.)

MOVE THROUGH ROOM, hearing more CONVERSATION.

FIND MARLA'S FACE, over the shoulder of a MAN she's being
embraced by, SMOKING, blowing smoke rings.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

This ... chick ... Marla Singer...
did not have testicular cancer.  She
had no diseases.  She was a liar.  I
saw her at "We Shall Overcome," my
melanoma group Monday night ...

INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

Marla sits with the group, smoking, while a member speaks. 
Jack glares at her.

INT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

Everyone sits with eyes closed while a speaker takes them
through a meditation.  Various COUGHING around the room. 
Jack's eyes open and he glares at Marla.  Her eyes are closed
and she's smoking a cigarette.

JACK (V.O.)

... at "Seize The Day," my
tuberculosis group Friday night.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - RESUMING

Jack continues to glare at Marla.  Her eyes briefly catch
his, then roll.  Another puff of the cigarette.

JACK (V.O.)

Marla -- the big tourist.  The faker. 
With her there, I was a faker, too. 
Her lie reflected my lie.  And all
of a sudden, I felt nothing.

9.

With her there, I couldn't cry.

INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jack, fully clothed, lies on top of his bed, holding a
cordless phone to his ear.  He stares at the ceiling and
swats at a fly.

So, once again, I couldn't sleep.

JACK (V.O.)

Jack hears something on the phone.  He sits up.

I've been holding for thirty minutes.

JACK (CONT'D)

Spread all over the floor by Jack's feet are INVOICES for
CREDIT CARDS.

JACK (CONT'D)

Yes, that's right.  Yes, but I
transferred part of my balance to my
Visa to get the lower rate.  Oh,
wait.  No, it wasn't your Visa. 
Okay, I transferred all of the
MasterCard ... to ... Look, can I
just come down in person?  I live
here -- in Wilmington.  Yes, all my
credit cards have main headquarters
here.  No?  Why not?  Why can't I
speak to an account rep?  No, wait,
don't put me on --

Jack reacts to being put on hold.

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jack sits on the toilet.  He digs through a magazine rack. 
IKEA catalogues, Pottery Barn catalogues and more of the
kind.  Jack opens an IKEA catalog and flips through it.

JACK (V.O.)

I had become a slave to the IKEA
nesting instinct.  If I saw something
like the clever Njurunda coffee tables
in the shape of a lime green Yin and
an orange Yang --

Move in on PHOTO of the tables.  CUT TO:

INT. JACK'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Completely EMPTY.

I had to have it.

JACK (V.O.)

10.

The Njurunda tables APPEAR.

INSERT - PHOTO OF SOFAS

The Haparanda sofa group ...

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

INT. JACK'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The sofa group APPEARS.

JACK (V.O.)

... with the orange slip covers by
Erika Pekkari.  The Johanneshov
armchair in the Strinne green stripe
pattern.

The armchair APPEARS.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The Rislampa/Har lamps from wire and
environmentally-friendly unbleached
paper.

The lamp APPEARS.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The Vild hall clock of galvanized
steel.

The clock APPEARS.

The Klipsk shelving unit.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The shelving unit APPEARS.

INT. BATHROOM - RESUMING

Jack flips the page of the catalogue to reveal a full-page
photo of an entire kitchen and dining room set.

JACK (V.O.)

I would flip and wonder, "What kind
of dining room set *defines* me as a
person?"

Jack drops the catalog down, open to this spread.  PAN OVER
to the magazine stack -- there's an old, tattered PLAYBOY.

It used to be Playboys; now -- IKEA.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

INT. JACK'S KITCHEN AND DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

-- Looking exactly like the photo in the catalogue.  Jack
walks in with

the cordless phone still glued to his ear.

JACK

I want to transfer my balance to get
a lower interest rate.

Jack looks over the whole kitchen, dining room, and the living
room beyond.

11.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The things you own, they end up owning
you.

Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
My hand-blown green glass dishes
with the tiny bubbles and
imperfections, proof they were crafted
by the honest, simple, hard-working
indigenous peoples of wherever.

He rummages through the refrigerator.  It's practically empty. 
Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses a butter
knife to eat it.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER

Jack lies on the bed, phone still at his ear.

I want to talk to a live person.

JACK

Jack reacts, listens, impatiently punches a single number;
waits, listens, punches another single number; listens.  He
rolls over, looks at one of the bills on the floor and punches
an entire credit card number.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Next support group, after guided
meditation, the white healing ball
of light, after we open our chakras,
when it comes time to hug, I'm going
to grab that little bitch, Marla
Singer, squeeze her arms down against
her sides and say ...

JACK (CONT'D)

Marla, you liar, you big tourist. 
Get out.

Jack yawns, rubs his eyes.  They stay wide open.  He punches
another number into the phone.  He sees a LEVITATING, STEAMING
Starbucks paper coffee cup move from side to side in front
of his face.

INT. COPY ROOM - DAY

Jack stands over a copy machine.  The Starbucks cup sits on
the lid, moving back and forth as the machine makes copies.

12.

JACK (V.O.)

With insomnia, nothing is real. 
Everything is far away.  Everything
is a copy of a copy of a copy.

Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping.

INT. OFFICE AREA - DAY

Floor-to-ceiling glass instead of walls.  Industrial low-
pile gray carpet.  Walls of upholstered plywood.  There are
four small offices connected by a hallway to one large office.

INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME

Jack, sipping from a Starbucks cup, stares blankly at his
Starbucks bag on the floor, full of newspapers.

JACK (V.O.)

When deep space exploitation ramps
up, it will be corporations that
name everything.  The IBM Stellar
Sphere.  The Philip Morris Galaxy.

Planet Starbucks.

Jack looks up as a pudgy MAN in his late thirties, enters. 
Starbucks cup in hand, pulls up a chair, and slides a stack
of reports on Jack's desk.  He pats Jack's back in a
superficially-friendly way.

PUDGY MAN

I'm going to need you out-of-town a
little more this week.  We've got
some "red-flags" to cover.

JACK (V.O.)

It must've been Tuesday.  My Boss
was wearing his cornflower-blue tie.

JACK (listless "management-speak") (CONT'D)

You want me to de-prioritize my
current reports until you advise of
a status upgrade?

PUDGY MAN - "BOSS"

You need to make these your primary
"action items".

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

He was full of pep.  Must've had his
latte enema.

13.

BOSS

Here's your flight coupons.  Call me
from the road if there's any snags. 
Your itinerary ...

Jack hides a yawn and pretends to listen.

JACK (V.O.)

When you have insomnia, you're never
really awake and you're never really
asleep, either.

INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

Jack walks in and joins the crowd.

Okay, everyone.  Chloe.

LEADER

Jack catches sight of Marla, scowls at her.  Taking the
lectern is CHLOE, a pale, sickly girl whose skin stretches
yellowish and tight around her bones.  She wears a head
bandage.  OVER the beginning of her SPEECH:

JACK (V.O.)

Chloe looked the way Joni Mitchell's
skeleton would look if you made it
smile and walk around a party being
extra nice to everyone.

CHLOE

My status update is ... I'm still
here -- but I don't know for how
long.  That's as much certainty as
they can give me.  I'm in a pretty
lonely place.  No one will have sex
with me.  I'm so close to death and
all I want is to get laid for the
last time.  I have pornographic movies
in my apartment, and lubricants and
amyl nitrate ...

The LEADER hardly knows what to do.  He inches his way to
the lectern, and gingerly takes control of the microphone.

LEADER

Thank you, Chloe.   Everyone, close
your eyes for meditation.  Go to
your cave and find your power animal.

EXT. ENTRANCE OF CAVE (JACK'S IMAGINATION)

Jack walks up to the entrance and finds MARLA -- smoking a
cigarette blowing smoke into his face, rolling her eyes in
condescension.

14.

Slide.

MARLA

INT. CHRUCH - RESUMING

Jack's eyes snap open and turn to Marla.  He glowers, watching
her smoke with her eyes closed.

INT. CHURCH - LATER

The Leader, smiling opens his eyes and looks around the group.

LEADER

Good.  Now.  Pair off for the one-on-
one.  Pick someone special to you
tonight.

Everyone stands and mills about, slowly pairing-off.  Jack
sees the ghastly spectre of Chloe coming towards him.  He
smiles at her.  She smiles back; it takes her some time to
amble to him.

CHLOE
Hello, Cornelius.

JACK (V.O.)

I never gave my real name at support
groups.

I'm showing signs of improvement.

CHLOE

JACK (V.O.)

Everyone was always getting better. 
They never said "parasite"; they
said "agent".

She smiles at him with a twisted, dying mouth.  Her eyes
eerily bright with desperation.  Jack's lip trembles as he,
in a sincere attempt at levity, chokes out:

You ... look ... like a pirate.

JACK (CONT'D)

Chloe laughs, a little too much.  Jack squeezes out a laugh. 
Then, he sees Marla, off by herself.  Someone is heading for
her.  Most people have paired-off.  Jack gives a quick nod
to Chloe and darts for Marla, grabbing her.  Chloe watches
in sad surprise.

STAY ON JACK AND MARLA as he drags her off to the periphery. 
He whispers into her ear.

We need to talk.

JACK (CONT'D)

15.

MARLA
O - *kay*.  Sure.

JACK

You're a faker.  You aren't dying. 
Okay, in the brainy brain-food
philosophy way, we're all dying. 
But you're not dying the way Chloe
is dying.

Tell the other person how you feel.

LEADER

MARLA

... *Cornelius*.

You're not dying, either ...

(reading his nametag)

Share yourself completely.

LEADER

These are my groups.  I found them!

JACK

I saw you practicing this.

MARLA

What?

JACK

MARLA

-- Telling me off.  Is it going as
well as you thought it would?

JACK
I'll expose you!

Go ahead.

MARLA

Let yourself cry.

MEDIATOR

Marla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were
crying.

Jack pulls her head back up.  She deadpans at him.

JACK

I've put in some serious time on
these groups -- I've been coming for
a year.

Must've been tough to pull off.

MARLA

JACK

Anyone who might've noticed me in
that time has either died or recovered
and never come back.

16.

MARLA
Why do you do it?

Why do you?

JACK

No answer.  The Leader passes right by Jack and Marla.

Open up.  share with each other.

LEADER

JACK

... If people think you're dying,
they really listen, instead of just
waiting for their turn to speak. 
Everything else about credit card
debts and sad radio songs and thinning
hair goes out the window.

MARLA

It started with a lump.  I went to a
breast cancer support group.  The
lump turned out benign.  But I still
needed my Monday fix.  So, I went to
lymphoma, just to check it out. 
Dying people are so *alive*.

It becomes an addiction.

JACK

Yeah ...

MARLA

Jack almost smiles, then turns sullen.  He pulls back from
her.

Now, the closing prayer.

LEADER

JACK

Look, I can't go to a group with a
faker present.

Marla's mood hardens.

Well, I can't either.

MARLA

Oh, bless us and hold us ...

LEADER

17.

We'll split up the week.

JACK

Marla starts out of the room.  Jack follows her.

... help us and help us.

LEADER

EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Marla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along.

JACK

You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis
and --

MARLA

No, you take tuberculosis.  My smoking
doesn't go over well.

JACK

I think testicular cancer should be
no contest.

MARLA

You have your balls, don't you? 
Technically, *I* have more of a right
to be there than you.

You're kidding.

JACK

I don't know -- am I?

MARLA

JACK FOLLOWS MARLA INTO

INT. LAUNDROMAT - CONTINUOUS

As she walks with authority up to an unwatched DRYER.  She
takes out all the clothes, sets them on a table and sorts
through them, picking out jeans, pants and shirts.

I'll take the parasites.

MARLA

JACK

You can't have *both* parasites. 
You take blood parasites and --

I want brain parasites.

MARLA

She opens another dryer and does the same thing again.

18.

JACK

Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and
I'll take organic brain dementia and --

I want that.

MARLA

You can't have the whole brain!

JACK

MARLA

So far, you have four and I have
two!

JACK

Well, then, take blood parasites. 
Now, we each have three.

Marla gathers up all the chosen garments and heads back for
the door.

She whooshes past Jack.

EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

Jack follows, bewildered.

You left half your clothes.

JACK

HONK!  Jack starts.  Marla's led him into the street with
traffic barreling down.  She defiantly stomps in front of
the cars, which screech to a halt and blare their horns. 
Jack dashes across.  Marla heads into a THRIFT STORE.  Jack
follows.

INT. THRIFT STORE - CONTINUOUS

Marla drops all the clothes on a back counter.  An old CLERK
sifts through the clothes, marks on a pad.

JACK

What are you doing?  You're selling
those clothes?

Marla steps down hard on Jack's foot.  He jerks, wincing in
pain.

MARLA (FOR THE CLERK TO HEAR)

Yes, I'm selling some clothes.

The Clerk starts to ring up the various amounts he's assessed.

19.

MARLA

So, we each have three -- that's
six.  What about the seventh day?  I
want ascending bowel cancer.

The girl had done her homework.

JACK (V.O.)

*I* want ascending bowel cancer.

JACK (CONT'D)

The Clerk gives Marla and Jack a strange look as he hands
over money to Marla.

MARLA

That's your favorite, too?  Tried to
slip it by me, huh?

JACK

We'll split it.  You get it the first
and third Sunday of the month.

Deal.

MARLA

They shake hands.  Jack starts to withdraw his; Marla holds
it.

I guess this is goodbye.

MARLA (CONT'D)

JACK

Let's not make a big deal out of
this.

She walks toward the door.  Jack watches her go.

MARLA (NOT LOOKING BACK)

How's this for not making a big deal?

EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

Jack dashes out and catches up to her.

JACK

Uh, Marla.  Should we exchange phone
numbers?

Should we?

MARLA

In case we want to switch nights.

JACK

Uh-hunh.  Sure.

MARLA

He takes out a business card and a pen.  He writes his home
number on the back and hands it to her.  She takes his pen,
grabs his hand and writes her number on his palm.  She gives
him a quick grin, slaps the pen back into his palm, then
saunters out into the middle of the street, causing more
screeching of tires and honking.  She turns back, holding up
the card.

20.

MARLA (CONT'D)

It doesn't have your name on it. 
Who are you?  Cornelius?  Any of the
stupid names you give at group?

Jack starts to yell, but the traffic noise is too loud. 
Marla just shakes her head at him, turns, and keeps moving
away.  A bus moves into view and stops, obscuring her.

JACK (V.O.)

Marla's philosophy of life, I later
found out, was that she could die at
any moment.  The tragedy of her life
was that she didn't.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

As the plane touches down for landing and the cabin BUMPS,
Jack's eyes pop open.

You wake up at O'Hare.

JACK (V.O.)

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

Jack snaps awake again, looking around, disoriented.

You wake up at SeaTac.

JACK (V.O.)

EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

The rear end of a car is visible sticking up by the side of
the road.

Jack stands near the car, marking on a document.  The SUN
SETS behind him.

INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

Jack walks up to a gate counter.  An ATTENDANT smiles at
him.

ATTENDANT

Check-in for that flight doesn't
begin for another two hours, Sir. 
Jack looks at his watch, steps away
and looks at an overhanging clock.

His eyes are bleary as he reads it, adjusts his watch.

21.

JACK (V.O.)

Pacific, Mountain, Central.  You
lose an hour, you gain an hour. 
This is your life, and it's ending
one minute at a time.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

Jack's eyes snap open as the plane LANDS.

JACK (V.O.)

You wake up at Air Harbor
International.

INT. AIRPORT WALKWAY

Jack stands on a conveyor belt, briefcase at his feet, moving
slowly with the flow of the belt.  His tired eyes watch people
on the opposite conveyor belt, moving past him.

JACK (V.O.)

If you wake up at a different time
and a different place, can you be a
different person?

Jack's eyes catch sight of TYLER -- who we recognize from
the opening sequence -- on the opposite conveyor belt.  They
pass each other.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

Jack sits next to a BUSINESSMAN.  As they have idle
CONVERSATION, we MOVE IN ON Jack's fold-out tray.

An ATTENDANT'S HANDS set coffee down with a small packet of
sugar and a small container of cream.

JACK (V.O.)

The charm of traveling is: everywhere
I go -- tiny life.

Single-serving sugar, single-serving cream.

CUT TO: THE HANDS PLACE A PLASTIC DINNER TRAY DOWN.  JACK
OPENS THE

various containers.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Single-serving butter, single-serving
salt.  Single-serving cordon blue.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jack brushes his teeth.

JACK (V.O.)

Single-use toothbrush.  Single-serving
mouthwash, single serving soap.

Jack picks up an individual, wrapped Q-TIP, looks at it.  He
moves out of the bathroom into

22.

MAIN AREA

And sits on the bed.  He turns on
the television.  It's tuned to the
"Sheraton Channel" and shows WAITERS
serving people in a large BANQUET
ROOM.  Jack stops brushing his teeth,
feels something near him on the bed,
finds it, lifts it.  It's a small
MINT.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

Jack sits next to a frumpy WOMAN and they chat.  Jack turns
to look at his food and takes a bite.  He turns back and
it's

-- a BALD MAN sitting next to him, talking.  He takes another
bite,

TURNS BACK AND IT'S

-- a BUSINESSMAN sitting next to him.  He takes another bite,
turns

BACK, AND IT'S

-- a BUSINESS WOMAN sitting next to
him.

JACK (V.O.)

The people I meet on each flight --
they're single-serving *friends*.

Between take-off and landing, we have our time together,
then we never see each other again.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - LANDING

Jack's eyes snap open.

You wake up at Logan.

JACK (V.O.)

EXT. CONCRETE LOT - DAY

Surrounded by cinderblock walls.  Two TECHNICIANS in uniform
lead Jack to a WAREHOUSE door.  They open it, revealing a
BURNT-OUT SHELL of a WRECKED AUTOMOBILE.  They move into the

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

And Jack sets down his briefcase, opens it, and starts to
make notes on a FORM.

23.

JACK (V.O.)

I'm a recall coordinator.  My job
was to apply the formula.  It's simple
arithmetic.

TECHNICIAN #1

Here's where the baby went through
the window.  Three points.

JACK (V.O.)

It's a story problem.  A new car
built by my company leaves Boston
traveling at 60 miles per hour.  The
rear differential locks up.

TECHNICIAN #2

The teenager's braces locked around
the backseat ashtray.  Kind makes a
good "anti-smoking" ad.

JACK (V.O.)

The car crashes and burns with
everyone trapped inside.  Now: do we
initiate a recall?

TECHNICIAN #1

The father must've been obese.  See
how the fat burned into the driver's
seat, mixed with the dye of his shirt? 
Kind like modern art.

JACK (V.O.)

You take the number of vehicles in
the field (A) and multiply it by the
probable rate of failure (B), multiply
the result by the average out-of-
court settlement (C).  A times B
times C equals X.  If X is less than
the cost of a recall, we don't do
one.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - TAKING OFF - NIGHT

Next to Jack, a chubby, middle-aged LADY gawks at him,
appalled.

LADY

... Which ... car company do you
work for?

A major one.

JACK

24.

Oh.

LADY

Jack turns his attention to the window as the PLANE ASCENDS. 
The lady's VOICE FADES.  Jack sees a PELICAN get SUCKED into
the TURBINE.

His face remains bland during the following:

The plane BUCKLES -- the cabin wobbles loosely.  People begin
to panic.

Oxygen masks fall.

JACK (V.O.)

Life insurance pays off triple if
you die on a business trip.

A forceful IMPACT with the ground and people -- except for
Jack --

LURCH FORWARD, some jerking against their seatbelts, magazines
and other objects fly forward.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

No more expense accounts, receipt
required for over twenty-five dollars.

A BALL OF FIRE swoops forward from the rear of the cabin and
INCINERATES EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY -- except Jack, who
remains in his same position in his seat, with the bland
expression.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

No more haircuts.  Nothing matters,
not even bad breath.

DING! -- the seatbelt light goes OUT.

*EVERYTHING IS NORMAL*.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Always the same fantasy.  But -- no
such luck.

Jack's eyes are closed.  He seems asleep.  From next to him,
a VOICE we've heard before.

VOICE

There are three ways to make napalm. 
One, mix equal parts of gasoline and
frozen orange juice.

Jack's eyes snap open and he turns to see *Tyler*, who is
staring out the window.  Without turning to Jack, he
continues:

TYLER

Two, mix equal parts of gasoline and
diet cola.  Three, dissolve crumbled
cat litter in gasoline until the
mixture is thick.

25.

Jack's smile fades.  Tyler turns to him and grins.  He reaches
down under the seat in front of him and pulls up a briefcase. 
Jack looks at it with trepidation.

This is how I met --

JACK (V.O.)

Tyler offers his hand, Jack takes it and Tyler squeezes firmly
and shakes hands.

TYLER

Tyler Durden.  You know why they
have oxygen masks on planes?

Supply oxygen?

JACK

TYLER

That's a sharp answer.  The oxygen
gets you high.  You're taking in
giant, panicked breaths and, suddenly,
you become euphoric and docile, and
you accept your fate.

Tyler grabs a safety instruction card from the seat pocket
and shows Jack the passive faces on the drawn figures.  Tyler
imitates the face.

Jack laughs; he is completely beguiled.

What do you do, Tyler?

JACK

What do you want me to do?

TYLER

I mean -- for a living.

JACK

TYLER

Why?  So you can say, "Oh, *that's*
what you do."  -- And be a smug little
shit about it?

Jack laughs.  He points to his own briefcase, under the seat
in front of him.

We have the same briefcase.

JACK

Tyler pops the latches on his briefcase.  A beat, while Jack's
expression turns nervous again about what's inside.  Tyler
swings the lid up, revealing a full bounty of quaintly-wrapped
bars of soap.

26.

I make and sell soap.

TYLER

He gives Jack one.  Jack takes it, looks it over.

TYLER (CONT'D)

If you add nitric acid to the soap-
making process, you get nitroglycerin. 
With enough soap, you could blow up
the world.

Jack now looks at the bar of soap nervously.  He looks at
Tyler, slowly smiles and shakes his head.

Tyler takes out a blank BOARDING PASS.  He takes out a small
stencil, scrapes a pencil over it, creating a seat number
which looks printed.

Then, he takes out a stamp and ink pad.  He stamps the pass.

JACK

Uh ... why are you going to
Wilmington?

I live there.

TYLER

Me, too.

JACK

Tyler shuts his briefcase and stands.

Excuse me.

TYLER

Jack stands, allowing Tyler to pass into the aisle.

So, uh ... we should hook up sometime.

JACK

Jack hands Tyler a business card.  Tyler snatches it, writes
down a number, hands it back to Jack.

JACK (CONT'D)

Tyler, you're by far the most
interesting "single-serving" friend
I've ever met.

A beat as Tyler stares at him, deadpan. 

Jack, enjoying his own chance to be witty, leans a bit closer
to Tyler.

27.

JACK (CONT'D)

You see, when you travel, everything
is --

TYLER

I grasp the concept.  You're very
clever.

Thank you.

JACK

TYLER

How's that working out for you?  --
Being clever.

Well, uh ... uh ... great.

JACK (thrown off)

Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.

TYLER

Jack sits and watches Tyler walk up to the curtain dividing
First Class.  Tyler show the bogus boarding pass to an
ATTENDANT, who leads him through the curtain.

INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - WILMINGTON - NIGHT

Utterly empty of baggage, and, except for Jack and a SECURITY
TASK FORCE MAN, utterly empty of people; quiet.  The Security
TFM, smirking, holds a receiver to his ear from an official
phone on the wall.

SECURITY TFM (TO JACK)

Throwers don't worry about ticking.  Modern bombs don't tick.

Throwers?

JACK

SECURITY TFM

Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase
vibrates, the throwers have to call
the police.

My suitcase was *vibrating*?

JACK

SECURITY TFM

Nine times out of ten, it's an
electric razor.  One out of ten,
it's a dildo.  Sometimes it's even a
*man*.  It's airline policy not to
imply ownership in the event of a
dildo.  We gotta use the indefinite
article:  "*A* dildo".  Never "*Your*
dildo".

28.

JACK (V.O.)

I had everything in that bag.  Six
white shirts, two black trousers,
six pair underwear, alarm clock,
contact lens stuff, and ... cordless
electric razor.

Yeah?  Oh, fuck, now a recording.

SECURITY TFM (into phone)

The Security TFM punches a few code numbers into the phone,
waits. 

CUT TO:

EXT. EMPTY RUNWAY - NIGHT

A solitary SUITCASE sits on the concrete.

KABOM!  The suitcase explodes.  CUT TO:

INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - RESUMING

The Security TFM still on hold, entertains Jack.

SECURITY TFM (to Jack)

You know the industry slang for
"flight attendant"?  "Air Mattress".

(into phone)

Yeah?  Really?

The Security TFM, turns to Jack, shakes his head, hangs up
the phone; shrugs.

EXT. AIRPORT DRIVE - MOMENTS LATER

Jack waits by the curb as a TAXI approaches.

JACK (V.O.)

Things could be worse.  A spider
could lay eggs under the skin in
your face and the larva could tunnel
around and baby spiders could burst
from your nostrils.

INT. TAXI - MOVING - NIGHT

Along a residential street.  Jack looks ahead, sees a tall
grey, bland building on the corner.

JACK (V.O.)

Home was a condo on the fifteenth
floor of a filing cabinet for widows
and young professionals.

The taxi approaches the intersection.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The walls were solid concrete.  A
foot of concrete is important when
your next-door neighbor lets her
hearing aid go and has to watch game
shows at full blast ...

29.

The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the
building.  A diffuse CLOUD of SMOKE wafts away from a BLOWN-
OUT SECTION on the fifteenth floor.  FIRETRUCKS, POLICECARS
and a MOB are all crowded around the lobby area.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

-- Or when a volcanic blast of burning
gas and debris that used to be your
furniture and personal effects blows
out your floor-to-ceiling window and
sails down flaming to leave just
your condo -- only yours --

a gutted, charred concrete hole in the cliffside of the
building.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BUILDING

Jack, gaping at the sight above him, absently gives the Cabbie
money.

The taxi pulls away.  Jack stands frozen.

These things happen.

JACK (V.O.)

Jack starts toward the building.  He enters the fray of
people, pushes through to the lobby.  The DOORMAN sees him,
gives a sad smile, shakes his head.  Jack starts for the
elevator.

There's nothing up there.

DOORMAN

Jack presses the button; waits.  The Doorman moves next to
him.

DOORMAN (CONT'D)

You can't go into the unit.  Police
orders.  They're investigating for
arson.

The elevator doors open.  Jack hesitates.  The doors close.

Do you have someone you can call?

DOORMAN (CONT'D)

Jack heads back for the lobby doors.  The Doorman follows.

EXT. CONDO BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Jack walks past SMOKING, CHARRED DEBRIS -- a flash of ORANGE 
from the Yang table, a CLOCK FACE from the hall clock, part
of an arm from the GREEN ARMCHAIR.  His feet CRUNCH glass. 
He gets to a payphone.  The

Doorman stays right with him, watching him.  CUT TO:

30.

CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S STOVE

Hissing.

JACK (V.O.)

Later, the police told me someone
could've turned the pilot light off,
turned a burner on.

EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

Jack picks up the receiver, stares at the numbers on the
phone.

DOORMAN

A lot of young people try to impress
the world and buy too many things.

CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S ENTIRE CONDO - KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM

Sound of the HISS.

JACK (V.O.)

The gas then could have slowly filled
the condo from floor to ceiling in
every room.  Seventeen-hundred square
feet with high ceilings for days and
days.

EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

Jack's fingers move over the numbers lightly, as he thinks.

DOORMAN

A lot of young people don't know
what they really want.

INSERT - CLOSE ON BASE OF JACK'S REFRIGERATOR

JACK (V.O.)

Then, the refrigerator's compressor
clicked on.

Click.  KABLAM!  SCREEN GOES WHITE.

31.

EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

Jack digs into his pocket, pulls out his business card, turns
it over

-- sees the number Tyler wrote.  He dials it.  Its rings ...
and rings.

He waits.

Tyler Durden.  Rescue me.

JACK (V.O.)

DOORMAN

Young people think they want the
whole world.

JACK (V.O.)

Deliver me from Swedish furniture. 
Deliver me from clever art.

DOORMAN

If you don't know what you want, you
end up with a lot you don't.

JACK (V.O.)

May I never be content.  May I never
be complete.  May I never be perfect. 
Deliver me.

Jack sighs and hands up the phone.  He starts to push past
the Doorman when the phone RINGS.  Jack grabs it.

Hello?

Who's this?

JACK (CONT'D)

TYLER'S VOICE

Tyler?

JACK

EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

A small building, sitting squarely in the middle of a large
concrete parking lot.  A few street lamps illuminate the
lot.  a freeway runs nearby.

INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

Jack and Tyler sit at a table in the very back of the room. 
A half-empty pitcher of beer shows dried foam scum from the
previous refill.

Five DRUNKEN GUYS at a table at the opposite side of the bar
keep glancing over and chuckling in a potentially hostile
manner.

32.

TYLER

You buy furniture.  You tell yourself,
this is the last sofa you'll ever
need in your life; no matter what
else goes wrong, you've got the sofa
issue handled.  Then the right set
of dishes.  Then the right bed.

The drapes.  The rug.  This is how you're good to yourself. 
This is how you fill up your life.

I ... guess so.

JACK

TYLER

And now your condo blows up and you
have nothing.

I ... guess so.

JACK

TYLER

And now you find yourself, sitting
here, feeling like it's the best
thing that ever happened to you.

... yeah.

JACK

TYLER

I don't know you, so maybe I'm wrong. 
Maybe it's a terrible fucking tragedy.

... no.

JACK

TYLER

I mean, you lost a lot of nice,
perfect, neat little shit.

Fuck it all.

JACK

Wow.  That's pretty strong.

TYLER

... yeah.

JACK

Do you have family you can call?

TYLER

My mother would just go into
hysterics.  My Dad ...  Don't know
where he is.

JACK

(MORE)

JACK (CONT'D)

Only knew him for six years.  Then,
he ran off to a new city and married
another woman and had more kids. 
Every six years -- new city, new
family.  He was setting up franchises.

Tyler smiles, snorts, shakes his head.

33.

TYLER

A generation of men raised by women. 
Look what it's done to you.

To me?

JACK

TYLER

We're on our third pitcher of beer
and you still can't ask me.

Huh?

JACK

TYLER

Why don't you cut the shit and ask
me if you can stay at my place?

Well ... uh ...

JACK

TYLER

Why don't you cut the shit and ask
me if you can stay at my place?

Would that be a problem?

JACK

Is it a problem for you to ask me?

TYLER

Can I stay at your place?

JACK

Yeah.

Thanks.

TYLER

JACK

-- If you do me one favor.

TYLER

What's that?

JACK

34.

TYLER

I want you to hit me as hard as you
can.

*FREEZE PICTURE*

JACK (V.O.)

Let me tell you a little bit about
Tyler Durden.

EXTREME CLOSE-UP - FILM FRAME

--And we can see it's a PENIS.

INT. PROJECTIONIST ROOM - THEATRE - NIGHT

Jack, in the foreground, FACES CAMERA.  In the BACKGROUND,
Tyler sits at a bench, looking at individual FRAMES that
have been cut out of movies.  Near him, the PROJECTOR rolls
a film.

JACK

Tyler works some nights as a
projectionist.  A film doesn't come
in one big reel ...

Tyler speaks to Jack normally, not to the camera.

TYLER

In an old theatre, two projectors
are used.  I have to change projectors
at the exact second so the audience
never sees the break when one reel
starts and one reel runs out.  You
can see two dots on screen at the
end of a reel -- this is the warning.

JACK

He splices single frames of genitalia
from porno movies into family films.

TYLER

One-twenty-forth of a second.  That's
how long the penis flashes up there. 
Towering, slippery, red and terrible,
and no one knows they've seen it.

Jack and Tyler watch the audience of PARENTS and CHILDREN as
an ANIMAL adventure MOVIE plays.  Suddenly, children start
becoming uncomfortable and squirming.  Some start CRYING. 
Some THROW UP.

Tyler also worked as a ...

JACK

INT. LARGE BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

Tyler moves the cart around one of many tables, ladling out
soup.

Jack stands in the same position.  FACING CAMERA.

35.

JACK

... banquet waiter at the luxurious
Pressman Hotel.

The GUESTS are dressed in resplendent clothes, reeking of
wealth and privilege.  They command the WAITERS with snaps
of the finger.

Complaints pop like gunshots.  The stiff-necked CATERING
MANAGER contemptuously hawk-eyes the waiters.  It's hellish.

INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Jack turns and WE PAN to Tyler, standing by a CART with a
giant SOUP TUREEN and bowls.  His hands are at his open fly
and he's in position to piss into the soup.

TYLER

Don't watch.  I can't if you watch
me.

CAMERA PANS to original position as Jack continues TO CAMERA.

JACK

He was a guerrilla terrorist of the
food service industry.

Shit.  I can't go.

TYLER (O.S.)

After a beat, the sound of WATER SPLASHING the floor.  Jack
peeks and sees Tyler pouring out a water glass with one hand,
the other hand at his crotch.

TYLER (CONT'D)
... Oh, yeah.  *Oh*, yeah.

Jack turns back TO CAMERA.

JACK

He farted on creme brulee; he sneezed
on braised endive; and, with creme
of mushroom soup, he ... he ...

Go ahead.  Say it.

TYLER (O.S.)

Well, you get the idea.

JACK

EXT. PARKING LOT OF TAVERN - RESUMING

Tyler and Jack come out of the bar; Jack shakes his head.

36.

What?

JACK

Hit me as hard as you can.

TYLER

Tyler leads Jack into an open area, lit by a streetlamp.

I don't know about this, Tyler.

JACK

TYLER

I don't know either.  I want to find
out.  We're virgins.  Neither one of
us has ever been hit.

You've never been in a fight?

JACK

TYLER

I didn't say that.  I said I've never
been hit.

That's good, isnt' it?

JACK

TYLER

Listen to me -- hit me.  You're the
only one I ever asked.

Me?

JACK

Jack stares at him.  The five drunken GUYS -- the same ones
who stared at them earlier -- have formed a distant perimeter,
sensing a fight.

Jack glances at them, then back at Tyler.

I've ... never hit anyone in my life.

JACK (CONT'D)

Go crazy.  Let it rip.

TYLER

JACK

Where do you want it?  In the face
or the stomach?

Surprise me.

TYLER

Jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse that connects with
Tyler's neck.

It makes a dull, soft flat sound.  Tyler's neck turns red.

37.

JACK

Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count. 
Let me try again.

Like hell.  That counted.

TYLER

Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest.  The impact
makes a dull, barely-audible sound and Jack falls back against
a car.  The Guys whoop and clap, moving closer.  Jack's eyes
involuntarily well up with tears.  He and Tyler breathe
HEAVILY and sprout BEADS of SWEAT on their faces.

How do you feel?

TYLER (CONT'D)

Strange.

JACK

But a *good* strange.

TYLER

Is it?

JACK

We've crossed the threshold.

TYLER

... I guess so.

JACK

You want to call it off?

TYLER

Call what off?

JACK

The fight.

TYLER

*What* fight?

JACK

TYLER

I'm tired of watching only
professionals.  I don't want to die
without any scars.  How much can you
really know about yourself if you
never go at it, one-on-one?

Tyler ...

JACK

38.

Are you a pussy?

TYLER

Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under Tyler's
ear.  The sound, soft and flat.  Tyler punches Jack in the
stomach.  The Guys move closer, cheering the fight.  Tyler
and Jack move clumsily, throwing punches.  They breathe
heavier, their eyes red and bright.

They drool saliva and blood.  They each hurt badly and become
dizzier from every impact.

JACK (V.O.)

If you've never been in a fight, you
wonder about getting hurt, about
what you're capable of doing against
another man.

Tyler and Jack keep fighting.  The guys mix laughter with
their cheers, looking at each other in wondrous amusement.

EXT. CURBSIDE - LATER

Jack and Tyler sit on the curb, staring at the sparse
headlights on the nearby freeway.  Their eyes are glazed
with endorphin-induced serenity.

They look at each other.  Laugh.  Look away.

What were you fighting?

TYLER

JACK

My job.  My boss, who fiddles with
my DOS execute commands.  Marla, at
my support groups.  Everything that's
broken and doesn't work in my life. 
What were you fighting?

My father.

TYLER

A pause as Jack studies Tyler's face.

We should do this again sometime.

JACK

Tyler cracks a smile, gives a sidelong glance to Jack, then
returns his stare to the night sky.

EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT

A street sign: "PAPER STREET".  An abandoned PAPER MILL 
sits on one side and only ONE HOUSE on the other, the rest
of the land being undeveloped grass and weeds.  It's an old,
grand, three-story gone to seed.  It looks abandoned, too.

39.

INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -SAME

Tyler leads Jack up a staircase to a 2ND FLOOR LANDING, then
opens the door to a room.

INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jack steps into the room, sits down on the old bed.  It
CREAKS.  Dust drifts upward.

JACK (V.O.)

I don't know how Tyler found the
house.  He'd been there for half a
year.  It was waiting for re-zoning
or something.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

LONG SHOT - ZOOMING OUT - A group of SIX GUYS watching TWO
GUYS in a

fist fight.  CUT TO:

INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Jack, his face showing new bruises and cuts, his knuckles
puffy, shoos away cockroaches as he makes coffee with a wire-
mesh strainer.  He has a happy little smile.

JACK (V.O.)

Nothing worked.  The rusty plumbing
leaked.  Turning on a light meant
that another light in the house went
out.  The stairs were ready to
collapse.

CUT TO:

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

LONG SHOT - ZOOMING OUT - Resuming from previous shot, getting
further

away, but now with TEN GUYS around two guys fighting.  CUT
TO:

INT. SHOWER - MORNING

Jack, showing some new bruises, with even fatter knuckles,
turns on the water.  LOUD VIBRATION  from the walls.  Water
spits in starts, then

dribbles out.  CUT TO:

40.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Tyler, in a nice suit, checks over the bars of soap in his
briefcase, then shuts it.  Jack walks in, dressed in his
work clothes.  He picks up a battered old saucepan with
boiling coal-black coffee and sips.  He offers it to Tyler,
who sips.  Jack pulls a TOOTH out of his mouth and throws it
into the sink.  They both walk out the door.

EXT. CINEMA PARKING LOT - NIGHT

LONG SHOT - ZOOMING OUT - Resuming from previous shot, getting
further

away, but now with FOURTEEN GUYS around a fight.  CUT TO:

EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

Tyler, in his waiter uniform, sits next to Jack on the lip
of the porch.  They both have newer, different bruises and
cuts, sit and guzzle beer.  THUNDERCLAPS.  RAIN begins to
fall.  Tyler gets to his feet.

INT. BASEMENT - SAME

Tyler and Jack are knee-deep in water, standing by a FUSEBOX. 
Tyler opens it.  He grabs two breaker switches, waits for
Jack.  Jack grabs two other switches,  apparently, they have
to do this in a certain

order.  Tyler flips his switches, then Jack flips his.  CUT
TO:

EXT. CONSTRUCTION AREA - NIGHT

LONG SHOT - ZOOMING OUT - Resuming from previous shot, getting
further

away, but now with EIGHTEEN GUYS around a fight.  CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rain DRIPS from the ceiling -- some of it from LIGHT FIXTURES. 
Tyler and Jack enter with LIT CANDLES.  They sit down on the
decrepit, buckled wood floor.  There's not one item of
furniture in the room.

There are, however, THOUSANDS of MAGAZINES.

JACK (V.O.)

The previous occupant collected
magazines.

They each pick up an opened magazine and resume reading,
adjusting close to the candles.

Tyler lies down next to him, setting his candle next to
Jack's.  Tyler picks up a magazine.

41.

What are your reading?

TYLER

JACK

"I Am Joe's Lungs".  It's written in
first person.  "Without me, Joe could
not take in oxygen to feed his red
blood cells".

Sounds fascinating.

TYLER

JACK

It's a whole series -- "I Am Joe's
Prostate".

"I get cancer, and I kill Joe".

TYLER

What are you reading?

JACK

TYLER

Soldier of Fortune,  National
Geographic.  New Republic.  Forbes.

Show-off.

JACK

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Every Wednesday night, after fighting
like wild animals, we were too wired
to go to sleep.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

In near DARKNESS as a SLIDE SHOW progresses, run by a chipper
salesman, WALTER.  Jack sits, deadpan, with a PUFFY LIP and
a BRUISE on his cheek.

JACK (V.O.)

Thursday morning, my Boss didn't
know what to think.

Boss blocks him from the rest of the room, gives him a dubious
look, turns back to Walter.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And all I could do was think about
next week.

Walter advances to the next slide, showing a view of a
COMPUTER SCREEN.

WALTER

The basic premise of microsofting
your office is -- make things more
efficient.

As Walter continues, his sales pitched gets drowned out by
Jack's narration:

42.

JACK (V.O.)

Walter, the Microsoft account exec,
smiled at me with his steam shovel
jaw.  Walter, with his smooth, soft
hands.  Here he was, doing his cute
little show.  Maybe thinking about a
free-range potluck he'd been to last
weekend, but probably not.

Walter moves to Jack and slaps his shoulder.

WALTER

I showed this already to my man here. 
You liked it, didn't you?

Slowly, Jack smiles.  His teeth are RED with BLOOD.  They
GLOW eerily in the dim light.

JACK (V.O.)

You can swallow a pint of blood before
you get sick.

WALTER

Jeez, I'd hate to see what happened
to the other guy.

Jack keeps the smile frozen on his face.

JACK (V.O.)

Fuck Walter.  His candy ass wouldn't
last a second in fight club.

EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

Out of silent darkness, HEADLIGHTS appear from all directions. 
A synchronous WAVE of cars PULLS UP and parks in the already-
filled lot.

Young men get out of the arriving cars and wander into the
tavern.  We recognize, among them, the GUYS who watched Tyler
and Jack's *first fight*.

INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

The men enter; the bartender, IRVINE, calls out:

IRVINE

Drink up people.  We're closing. 
Let's go.

43.

The crowd consists of men and women YUPPIES: blue collar
REGULARS dressed in work clothes or like cowboys; floozy
barfly WOMEN.  MUSIC plays from the jukebox.

The arriving men simply wait.  And wait.  Tyler and Jack
enter.  They, too, stand back against he wall.

The waiting army begins to share secret looks and grins.  A
certain level of eagerness can be seen among them.

Irvine looks at Jack and grins.  He flips on LIGHTS.  The
drunken customers squint and get the message.  They gulp
down their drinks, plop down money and filter out the door. 
Irvine hits a button and the jukebox loses  power -- the
record simply turns slower until it stops revolving.

Finally, the last of the irritated customers leaves.  One
guy locks the door.  Two other guys pull down blinds.  Someone
else moves over to the BASEMENT DOOR and opens it.

INT. BASEMENT STEPS - MOMENTS LATER

The grinning men march down steps; CHATTER begins.

I brought my roommate tonight.  Phil.

TALL GUY

Oh, yeah?  Hi, Phil.

FAT GUY

TALL GUY

He kept seeing what I looked like. 
Had to check it out.

INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - SAME

A BOMB-SHELTER -- concrete floor, concrete walls.  One BARE
LIGHT BULB hangs by a wire from the ceiling.  Tyler nods to
Jack and Jack turns on the light.  The guys mill around,
finding partners.  The whole mood is very friendly.  Everyone
brims with eagerness, but tries to act cool about it.  CHATTER
gets LOUDER.

A mean uppercut.

FAT GUY

I gotta work on my left.

WIRY GUY

*He's* got a left.

SHORT GUY

FAT GUY

Hey, you're wiping the floor with
dudes who are way out of your weight
class.

44.

TALL GUY (slapping Wiry Guy's shoulder)

Skinny guys.  They fight till they're burger.

PEAKING CHATTER, then -- Tyler moves into position directly
under the light bulb.  His face is partially in shadow.

Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, the light bulb for a
center.

Tyler's will WIPES through the room and the CHATTER DIES.  A
couple of COUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING.  Then, SILENCE.

TYLER

The first rule of fight club is --
you don't talk about fight club.

The second rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about
fight club.

Jack glances over at a short guy, RICKY, with a BLACK EYE.

JACK (V.O.)

This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk --
he can't remember whether you ordered
pens with blue ink or black ink ...

TYLER

The third rule in fight club is --
when someone says "stop" or goes
limp, the fight is over.  The fourth
rule is -- only two guys to a fight.

JACK (V.O.)

But Ricky was a god for ten minutes
when he trounced an actuary twice
his size.

TYLER

Fifth rule -- one fight at a time. 
Sixth rule -- no shirts or shoes.

Seventh rule -- fights go on as long as they have to.  And
the eighth rule of fight club is -- if this is your first
night, you *have* to fight.

Tyler steps back, and a FAT MAN and a GOATEED MAN take off
their shirts and shoes and step into the center.  They circle
each other, then begin throwing punches.  SWEAT flies into
the moist air.  SHOUTS become

DEAFENING.

JACK (V.O.)

Sometimes you could hear flat, hard
packing sounds over all the yelling

(MORE)

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
as someone caught his breath and
sprayed:

Ssstop.

GOATEED MAN

45.

INT. OFFICE PARK RESTAURANT - DAY

Jack, eating lunch, is served a refill soda by the BROKEN-
NOSED WAITER with a GOATEE, the man from the above fight.

JACK (V.O.)

Even if I could tell someone they
had a good fight, I wouldn't be
talking to the same man.  Who you
were in fight club is not who you
were in the rest of your world.  You
weren't alive anywhere like you were
alive at fight club.  But fight club
only exists in the hours between
when fight club starts and when fight
club ends.

INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

Boss, passing by the doorway, looks in at Jack with irritated
wonder.

Jack, playing solitaire on his computer, daubs blood from
his mouth with a handkerchief.

BOSS

What are you getting yourself into
every week?

Jack flashes a smile at Boss.  Boss shakes his head, walks
away.

JACK (V.O.)

After a night in fight club,
everything else in your life gets
the volume turned down.  You can
deal with anything.  All the people
who used to have power over you have
less and less.

Reflexively, Jack's tongue plays with his teeth.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

By this point, I could wiggle most
of the teeth in my jaw.

INT. BUS - DAY

Jack stands, holding a hand grip.  An arrogant MAN in a three-
piece suit brushes past him, knockng his shoulder.

We all started to size people up.

JACK (V.O.)

Jack violently knocks the Man's shoulder in return.  The Man
turns and he and Jack face each other for a brief moment. 
Jack's face is stone.

46.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I'd look at some asshole and *know*
I could beat him.

The arrogant Man continues down the aisle.  Jack notices a
GUY with SMASHED LIP.  The Guy grins, giving a slight nod.

INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Jack walks past the parking garage.  He sees a VALET who has
facial bruises.

We were all doing it.

JACK (V.O.)

The Valet and Jack share a quick smile.  A BMW pulls up and
HONKS at the Bruised Valet. The bruised Valet has no reaction
as a FAT EXEC gets out of his car and tosses the keys.  Jack
watches the Bruised Valet size up the Exec, then hop into
the car and loudly PEEL OUT.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I would see them all the time --
fight club members looking at other
guys, knowing they could kick their
asses.

INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT

Jack lands a couple of jabs to HIS OPPONENT'S stomach, then
brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw. 
Tiny spatters of BLOOD adorn the walls, along with sweat.

JACK (V.O.)

Fight club was not about winning or
losing.  It wasn't about words.

The Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack.  Jack snakes
his arm into a counter headlock.  They, wrestling like wild
animals.  The crowd CHEERS maniacally.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

The hysterical shouting was in
tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.

The onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering ever
louder.  The Opponent smashes Jack's head into the floor,
over and over.

Stop.

JACK (CONT'D)

Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away.  They lift
Jack to his feet.  On the floor is a BLOOD MASK of Jack's
face -- similar to his TEAR MASK on BOB'S SHIRT, seen earlier. 
Tyler pushes through the crowd.

47.

Cool.

TYLER

EXT. BAR - NIGHT

Everyone files out of the bar, sweating, bleeding, smiling.

Afterwards, we all felt saved.

JACK (V.O.)

EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Jack and Tyler walk through the pools of light cast by
streetlamps.

They both drip blood and sport bruises.  They each carry a
4x4 piece of WOOD.  As they pass parked cars, they SLAM the
sticks against the front bumpers, setting off the ALARMS and
causing the AIR BAGS to INFLATE.

They come to a bus stop that has a large display ad for jeans. 
It has a photo of a shirtless man.

Is that what a man looks like?

TYLER

Isn't it?

JACK

Tyler smears blood on the ad.  They continue on their way. 
Tyler comes to a "ROAD WORK" sign.  Tyler kicks it into a
deep HOLE.  He and Jack tightrope-walk on wooden beams over
darkness.

TYLER

Guys packing into the gyms, all trying
to look like what Calvin Klein says. 
Fight club isn't about looking good.

As they step back onto solid pavement, Tyler kicks one of
the beams, causing it to come loose and fall.  The whole
temporary work structure falls into the hole.  Tyler and
Jack continue walking.  IN the background, a car SKIDS and
FISHTAILS, avoiding the hole.

Sound of a SIREN getting closer.  Tyler hands Jack the 4x4
and runs, laughing.  Jack stands there a moment, then throws
the stick and runs after Tyler.

JACK (V.O.)

A guy comes to fight club for the
first time, and his ass is a wad of
cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he
looks carved out of wood.  He trusts
himself to handle anything.

48.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET - CONTINUOUS

Jack and Tyler, panting, sweat mixing with blood, slow down
and resume walking.  Tyler pulls his fingers, popping them --
his knuckles are swollen.  He grins at the pain.

TYLER

Self-improvement is masturbaation. 
Self-destruction is the answer.

INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

The PHONE RINGS.  Jack enters from the living room, buttoning
his shirt.  He answers.

Hello?

JACK

INTERCUT WITH

INT. MARLA'S ROOM - SAME

She lies on the bed, twisting the phone cord around her neck
like a noose.

MARLA

Where have you been the last few
weeks?

Marla?

JACK

MARLA

I haven't seen you at any support
groups.

That's the idea -- we split them.

JACK

You haven't been going to yours.

MARLA

I found a new one.

JACK

Really?  Can I go to it?

MARLA

It's for men.

JACK

49.

Like testicular cancer?

MARLA

Like that.  Look, this is a bad time.

JACK

MARLA

I started going to debtor's anonymous. 
You want to see *really* fucked up
people?

Look, I'm going out ...

JACK

MARLA

I'm going out of my mind.  I got a
stomach full of Xanax.  I took what
was left of the bottle.  Might've
been too much ... probably was.

Jack turns TO CAMERA.

JACK (V.O.)

Picture yourself watching Marla throw
herself around her crummy apartment,
saying, "I'm dying.  Dying.  Dying. 
It could go on for hours.

JACK (CONT'D)

You probably want to die in peace. 
I'll let you go.

MARLA

Stay on the line.  I want you to
hear me describe death.

Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the
hook, and walks out of the kitchen.

MARLA'S VOICE

I want to see if my spirit can use
the telephone.

INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

GRUNTS OF PLEASURE AND EXERTION.  IN DIM LIGHT, WE GET
GLIMPSES OF TORSOS, ASSES, LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, AND BLACK
FEMALE HAIR -- ALL DRENECHED IN SWEAT.  SHEETS RIP.  CA-
CHUNK! CA-CHUNK! BODIES HIT THE FLOOR AND ROLL.  MORE INSANE
GRUNTING.  AND LAUGHING -- CACKLING.

flash of MARLA'S FACE.  Then, groans of ecstasy approaching
climax.

CUT TO:

INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - SUNRISE

Jack sits up in bed, looks around the room.

INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING

Jack steps out of his room, looks down to the next door --
the door is closed.

50.

JACK (V.O.)

Tyler's door was closed.  I'd been
living here a month, and Tyler's
door never closed.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME

Jack stares into the toilet.  CLOSE UP - SIX USED CONDOMS IN
TOILET.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Jack sits at the table, sipping coffee, reading Reader's
Digest.  He takes in a long yawn, rubs his eyes.  He hears
FOOTSTEPS approaching.

JACK

You're not going to believe the dream
I had.

Marla walks in, straightening her dress.  She looks like
she's been raped by a hurricane.  Some of her hair is matted
against her head, some of it is sticking out wildly.  Jack
gapes at her in shock.  She cracks a coy smile and runs a
finger across the back of his neck.

MARLA

I can hardly believe *anything* about
last night.

She pours herself a cup of coffee.  She takes a big gulp,
GARGLES and SPITS it out into the sink.  She gives Jack a
lascivious smile.  Then, she sips from the cup.  She strokes
his hair.  He pulls back from her.

What the fuck are you doing here?!

JACK

Marla looks at him a beat, then throws the cup into the sink
and it

SHATTERS.

Fuck you.

MARLA

51.

She kicks open the door to the backyard and walks out.  Jack
watches her stomp across the lawn to the sidewalk and down
the street.

Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after
Marla.  He's in his usual sweatpants.  He grins at Jack,
then moves away, pours himself coffee.  Jack, smoldering,
slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest.  Tyler
puts his foot on a countertop and begins to do stretching
exercises.

TYLER

That crazy bitch almost fucked me in
half.   Get this -- I come home and
the phone is off the hook ...

MOVE IN ON JACK'S FACE as he pretends to read, but glances
up at Tyler.

TYLER'S VOICE FADES AS:

JACK (V.O.)

I already knew the story before he
told it to me.

INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

Tyler enters through the back door and moves to the phone.

MARLA'S VOICE (FROM HANDSET)

I'll tell you when I'm floating out of my body.

Gently, Tyler lifts the handset and listens, smiling.

JACK (V.O.)

I don't know why, but Tyler actually
thought it was a *bad* thing that
Marla was about to die.

INT. 8TH FLOOR LANDING - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

Tyler reaches the top of the stairs and heads for Marla's
room.  Before he can knock, Marla's hand shoots out and grabs
Tyler's arm.

INT. MARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

Marla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door.  Her drugged
eyes look him over.

You got here fast.

MARLA

She staggers and sits on the bed.  She slides off, along
with the blanket and sheets, to the floor.

52.

MARLA (CONT'D)

The mattresses here are all sealed
in slippery plastic.

She tries to focus her eye on Tyler.

Did I call you?

MARLA (CONT'D)

SIRENS and vehicles SCREECHING to a halt outside.  Doors
opening and SLAMMING; running FOOTFALL.  Marla scowls and
RAMS Tyler with her knee, knocking him off her.

You called the cops?!  Shit!

MARLA (CONT'D)

She gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, hauls him to his feet and
pulls him out the door.

INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK)

Marla LOCKS her door, then shoves Tyler toward the staircase. 
She and Tyler suddenly flatten agains the wall as COPS and
PARAMEDICS charge by with oxygen.

Where's 8-G?

COP

End of the hall.

MARLA

The rescuers keep running.  Marla and Tyler start down the
steps.

Marla lingers a beat, hearing the cops bang on the door. 
She calls out to them:

MARLA (CONT'D)

The girl who lives there used to be
a charming, lovely girl.  But she
has no faith in herself.

Tyler yanks on Marla's arm.  They continue down the steps,
with Marla's speech getting louder.

MARLA (CONT'D)

And she's worried that, as she grows
older, she'll have less options.

She's turned into a monster!  She's infectious human waste! 
Good luck trying to save her!

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Tyler makes coffee.  Marla slouches against the refrigerator.

53.

MARLA

If I fall asleep, I die.  You have
to keep me up all night.

Tyler smiles.

He was able to handle it.

JACK (V.O.)

INT. TYLER'S ROOM - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

Marla and Tyler, in a wrecked bed.  Tyler's eyes are closed. 
Marla kisses his ear.

MARLA

According to ancient Chinese custom,
you're responsible for me forever,
because you saved my life.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING - RESUMING

Tyler gulps some coffee, shaking his head.

TYLER

... And she's spouting this crap she
got from watching too much television.

JACK (V.O.)

If only I hadn't gone to a movie. 
If only I went to her stupid room to
watch her die.

Tyler sits opposite him, studies his face.

You aren't doing her, are you?

TYLER

I Am Joe's Raging Bile Duct.

JACK (V.O.)

No.

JACK (CONT'D)

I didn't think so.

TYLER

You didn't think so?

JACK

She's not your type.

TYLER

How would you know what my type is?

JACK

She's just a wild, twisted bitch.

TYLER

54.

JACK

Oh, and my pace is more librarians
and den mothers.

Kinky.

TYLER

JACK (V.O.)

How could someone like Tyler get
involved with someone like Marla
Singer?  It was impossible.

JACK (CONT'D)

Marla doesn't need a lover.  She
needs a case worker.

TYLER

This is sport-fucking.  She's a
hosebag.

JACK (V.O.)

She invaded my support groups, now
she's invaded my home.  My friendship. 
Like a cancer.

You're okay, aren't you?

TYLER

I Am Joe's Clenching Bowels.

JACK (V.O.)

Sure.

JACK (CONT'D)

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Put a gun to my head and paint the
wall with my brains.

It's fine, great.

JACK (CONT'D)

TYLER

Now, listen.  You gotta understand
something about me.  I got a little
rule.  Don't ever talk to her about
me.  I can't stand that kind of shit.

Tyler fixes Jack with a friendly, but firm stare.

TYLER (CONT'D)

If you ever mention me to her -- or
anyone else -- I'll find out about
it.  And you'll never see me again.

Okay.

JACK

You promise?

TYLER

I promise.

JACK

55.

Tyler abruptly gets up and leaves the kitchen.  Jack watches
him go, smoldering.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jack sits watching television at HIGH VOLUME.  Sounds of
ROUGH SEX from upstairs.

CUT TO:

INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jack lies calmly, in a Zen state, on his bed, staring at the
ceilng.

Sounds of THUMPS and CRASHES from beyond the wall, along
with Tyler's and Marla's VOICES, SNARLING:

You slimy discharge!

MARLA'S VOICE

JACK (V.O.)

I could've moved to another room,
one on the third floor -- so I
wouldn't have heard them.  But I
didn't.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jack brushes his teeth.

I wrote little haiku things:

JACK (V.O.)

"Worker bees can leave Even drones can fly away The queen is
their slave"

I became the calm little center of the world.  I was the Zen
master.

MOVE IN ON -- KEYHOLE - Jack's EYE

MARLA

(gasping in passion)

I love you.  I want to have your
abortion.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

Sound of RAIN pelting the house.  Jack flips the fuses off,
walks up the stairs.

56.

JACK (V.O.)

"A tiger can smile A snake will say
it loves you Lies make us evil"

INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - SAME

Jack walks up the steps.  He hears Marla SCREAM in orgasm. 
He reaches the landing.  Tyler's door is slightly ajar. 
Jack can't help stopping.

JACK'S POV - TYLER'S ROOM

Marla's legs are sprawled on the bed.  Her head is down over
the far side, out of view.  The door PUSHES OPEN WIDER --
Tyler, naked, stands

CLOSE TO CAMERA.

What are you doing?

TYLER

Jack steps back.

WIDE ON LANDING

I ... uh ... just going to bed.

JACK

Tyler grins and nods toward bed.

You want to finish her off?

TYLER

Uh ... nah ...

JACK

Jack continues toward his room.

INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

Jack's clothes are PERMANENTLY STAINED with BLOOD.  He sits
in his Zen pose, typing.  We see his HAIKUS on the screen.

I faxed them around to everyone.

JACK (V.O.)

He hits "SEND".  Boss enters, reacts with exasperated
irritaiton at the sight.

Is that your blood?

BOSS

*Some* of it, yeah.

JACK

Boss stares at Jack like he's from Mars.

57.

BOSS

Take the rest of the day off.  Come
back tomorrow with clean clothes.

And get yourself together.

INT. HALLWAY - SAME

Jack, looking like a war casualty, walks past COWORKERS who
coldly stare at him.  His face is totally passive.

JACK (V.O.)

I got right in everyone's hostile
little face.  Yes, these are bruises
from fighting.  See?  It's nothing
to me?  See how cool I am about it?

That's right, I'm enlightened!

EXT. PAPER STREET - SUNSET

Jack walks toward the house.

JACK (V.O.)

You give up the condo life, give up
all your worldly possessions and go
live in a dilapidated house in the
toxic waste part of town.

INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN - SUNSET

Jack walks inside.  Sound of VIOLENT SEX from upstairs --
THUDS and WHAMS.  Pieces of PLASTER fall from the ceiling in
tufts of dust.

... And you come home to *this*.

JACK (V.O.)

Take that, butt wipe!!

TYLER'S VOICE

Jack rolls his eyes, takes off his pants.  He runs water in
the sink.

He takes a tiny bit of soap and begins to scrub the blood
stains.

PHONE RINGS.  He answers.

Hello?  Speaking.

JACK

INTERCUT WITH

INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE

DETECTIVE STERN leans forward in his chair, consulting a
file.

58.

DETECTIVE STERN

This is Detective Stern with the
arson unit.  We have some new
information about your condo.  The
deadbolt on your front door was
shattered.  Someone sprayed freon
into the lock to freeze it.  Then,
they tapped it with a cold chisel to
shatter the cylinder.

I Am Joe's Cold Sweat.

JACK (V.O.)

And, in fact, cold sweat beads up on Jack's forehead.  He
scrubs his pants obsessively.

DETECTIVE STERN

The dynamite had a residue of ammonium
oxalate and potassium perchloride --
this means we can assume it was
homemade.

JACK

This is ... really a shock to me,
Sir.

DETECTIVE STERN

Whoever set the dynamite could've
turned on the gas and blown out the
pilot lights on the stove days before
the explosion took place.  The gas
was just the trigger.

Who do you think did it?

JACK

I'm asking the questions, son.

DETECTIVE STERN

JACK

I loved my life.  I loved that condo. 
I loved every stick of furniture. 
That was my whole life.  Everything --
the lamps, the chairs, the rugs --
*were* me.  The dishes were me.  The
plants were me.  The television was
me.

I'd like to thank the academy ...

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

59.

DETECTIVE STERN

Do you know anyone who'd have the
expertise and the motive to do
something like this?

Jack's eyes move upward, then back down.

Uh ... no.

JACK

DETECTIVE STERN

Well, think about it.  If any ideas
come to you, give me a call.  And,
in the meantime, don't leave town.

END INTERCUT

Jack hangs up the phone, turns to
see Tyler standing right next to
him.

Tyler puts a hand on Jack's shoulder, squeezes it
affectionately.

Jack turns away and continues to scrub -- rebuffing Tyler. 
Tyler smiles compassionately at him.

Marla's FOOTSTEPS can be heard coming down the stairs.  JACK'S
POV --

as he really grinds the soap against the pants, splashes
water all over the place.

JACK'S POV PIVOTS, WIDEN ON ROOM.  MARLA ENTERS.  TYLER IS
GONE.  JACK

looks around to the open back door, then back at Marla.  She
lights a cigarette.

JACK (V.O.)

Except for their humping, Tyler and
Marla were never in the same room.

The same disappearing act my parents pulled for years -- one
came in, and the other was gone.

Marla moves very close to Jack and props a leg up on a stack
of magazines near him.  She's not wearing underwear.  Jack
becomes very aware of his having no pants on, so he pushes
up against the counter.

Marla lasciviously pulls the hemline further up her leg.

MARLA

I got this dress at a thrift store
for one dollar.

60.

It was worth every penny.

JACK

MARLA

It's a bridesmaid's dress.  Someone
loved it intensely for one day, then
tossed it.  Like a Christmas tree --
so special, then, bam, it's on the
side of the road with tinsel still
clinging to it.

She leans in very close to his ear and whispers hoarsely:

You can borrow it sometime.

MARLA (CONT'D)

That's hysterical.

JACK

Marla blows smoke into Jack's face.  He grabs her cigarette,
throws it into the water in the sink.  She smiles saucily
and LEAVES the room.

Sound of her FOOTSTEPS going upstairs.

Get rid of her.

TYLER (O.S.)

Jack turns and sees Tyler in the back doorway.

*You* get rid of her.

JACK

TYLER

And don't mention my name.  You
promised.

Yes, yes, I promise.

JACK

Promise?

TYLER

I said I promise!

JACK

That was three times you promised.

TYLER

Marla's FOOTSTEPS can be heard coming down the staircase.

Tell her to go.

TYLER (CONT'D)

Jack looks toward the archway, then back at -- ?  Tyler is
GONE.  Marla glides into the kitchen with a PACK of
cigarettes.  She daintily takes one out and lights it.

JACK (V.O.)

I'm six years old again, passing
messages between my parents.

Uh ... I think you should go now.

JACK (CONT'D)

61.

Marla begins to do a slow, exotic dance around the kitchen,
sometimes moving very close to Jack, sometimes moving away. 
She lifts her dress dangerously high -- does she expose
herself? -- hard to tell.  She dances very close to Jack's
body, almost touching it.

What are you trying to do?!

JACK (CONT'D)

Marla stops dancing, and BURSTS into loud LAUGHTER.

MARLA

You're such a nutcase, I can't even
begin to keep up.

She touches Jack's hair.  He slaps her hand away.

Just get out of here.

JACK

Marla's face turns sour.  As she stomps out the back door --

MARLA

I'm already so fucking gone that all
you see is an after-image.

Jack watches her through the kitchen window.

Good job.

TYLER (O.S.)

As Jack turns, we WIDEN to include Tyler, standing right
behind Jack, beaming.  Through the window, in the background,
Marla can be seen quickly moving away on the sidewalk.  Tyler
puts his hand on Jack's shoulder.

TYLER (CONT'D)

Let's get out of this place for
awhile, take a walk.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Tyler moves forward at a brisk pace.  Jack keeps up with
him.  Tyler cuts across a paved road and into a WOODED AREA. 
Jack follows.

EXT. ALL-NIGHT CONVENIENCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER

Tyler, with Jack following, emerges from the trees and heads
into the parking lot.

A Clerk ambles toward his car, taking off his uniform bow
tie.  Tyler suddenly pulls a HANDGUN out of his belt and
rams it against the Clerk's head.

EXT. WOODED AREA - CONTINUOUS

Tyler marches the Clerk, the gun aimed at his head.  Jack
follows.

62.

What are you doing?!

JACK

Shut up.

TYLER

Are you out of your fucking mind?!

JACK

Shut up.

TYLER

Tyler stops the Clerk and pushes him down to a kneeling
position.

Give me your wallet.

TYLER (CONT'D)

The Clerk fumbles his wallet out of his pocket and Tyler
snatches it.

Tyler pulls out the driver's license.

TYLER (CONT'D)

Raymond K. Hessel.  1320 SE Benning,
apartment A.  A small, cramped
basement apartment.

How'd you know?

RAYMOND

TYLER

They give basement apartments letters
instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're
going to die.

Please, God, no.

RAYMOND

What are you doing?!

JACK

TYLER

(to Jack)

SHUT UP!  You have no idea of what
it is to hit bottom.  I've been trying
to get you there -- I blew up your
condo.

63.

... The ... cops are onto you.

JACK

No, they think *you* did it.

TYLER

TYLER CONTINUES, TO RAYMOND:

TYLER (CONT'D)

Your mom and dad will have to call
old doctor so-and-so to get your
dental records, because there won't
be much of your face left.

Raymond begins to weep, his shoulders heaving.  Jack starts
to gasp for air.  Growing even paler, he slumps back against
a tree.  His mouth becomes dry.

Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?

TYLER (CONT'D)

Yesss ...

RAYMOND

Look, if this is all about me ...

JACK

You?  Nothing is about you.

TYLER

I'm doing okay, aren't I?

JACK

TYLER

You don't have your cute, little
condo or your fey furniture, you're
living in squalor ...

TYLER CONTINUES, TO RAYMOND:

TYLER (CONT'D)

An expired community college student
ID card.  What did you used to study,
Raymond K. Hessel?

S-S-Stuff.

RAYMOND

"Stuff".  Were the mid-terms hard?

TYLER

Tyler shoves the gun against Raymond's temple.

I asked you what you studied.

TYLER (CONT'D)

64.

Biology, mostly.

RAYMOND

Why?

TYLER

I don't know.

RAYMOND

TYLER

What did you want to be Raymond K.
Hessel?

A long beat while Raymond weeps and says nothing.  Tyler
COCKS the gun.

Jack JERKS back, wincing, sweating.

... Tyler?

I'm busy.

JACK

TYLER

TYLER CONTINUES, TO RAYMOND:

TYLER (CONT'D)

The question, Raymond, was "what did
you want to be"?

Tyler begins to squeeze the trigger.

JACK (CROAKING WITH DRY MOUTH)

Answer him!

A VETERINARIAN!

RAYMOND

Animals.

TYLER

Yeah ... animals and s-s-s --

RAYMOND

TYLER

-- *Stuff*.  That means you have to
get more schooling.

Too much school.

RAYMOND

Would you rather be dead?

TYLER

Tyler shoves Raymond's wallet back into his pocket.

65.

TYLER (CONT'D)

I'm keeping your license.  I know
where you live.  I'm going to check
on you.  If you aren't back in school
on your way to being a veterinarian,
you will be dead.  Now, get the hell
out of here.

Raymond staggers into the darkness.  Tyler watches.  Jack,
still clinging to a branch with a deathgrip, looks at Tyler. 
Tyler slowly turns to face Jack.

TYLER (CONT'D)

Raymond K. Hessel, tomorrow will be
the most beautiful day of your life. 
Your breakfast is going to taste
better than any meal you've ever
eaten.

Jack's eyes light up.  He looks at the fleeing Raymond, then
back at Tyler.  He sighs, then shakes his head, then cracks
his weird, little crooked smile.  His eyes glow.  He looks
with almost religious reverence at Tyler.

Tyler turns and smiles at Jack.

TYLER (CONT'D)

To make soap, first you have to render
fat.

CLOSE UP - SIGN:  "DANGER - BIOHAZARD"

PULL BACK TO WIDE ON

EXT. FENCED-IN BIOHAZARD WASTE DUMP SITE - NIGHT

Tyler is on the ground, inside the fence.  Jack's at the top
of the fence, trying to get through the BARBED WIRE.  He
does so, but wobbles and gets his shirt snagged.  Tyler tries
to help him.  Jack falls, ripping his shirt.  Tyler breaks
the fall, gets Jack to his feet.

FOOTSTEPS.  FLASHLIGHT BEAM.  Tyler pulls Jack down behind a
DUMPSTER

-- one of DOZENS in the site.  A silhouette of a SECURITY
GUARD moves

along the perimeter, waving the flashlight around.  He finally
walks back toward the adjacent building, goes inside.

MOVE BACK to Tyler and Jack, who emerge from hiding.  Tyler
eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster.  Jack gapes
at the "biohazard" sign.

TYLER

The best fat for making soap --
because the salt balance is just
right -- comes from human bodies.

66.

Tyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS.  Jack breathes heavily,
afraid to look.  Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized, think
plastic bag full of PINK GOO.  Jack reacts to the smell,
turning away.  His eyes focus on the side of the adjacent
building and its SIGN:  "BODY SCULPTING

CLINIC".

TYLER (CONT'D)

>From the asses and thighs of rich
women, paydirt.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jack watches at Tyler stirs a boiling pot.

TYLER

As the fat renders, the tallow floats
to the surface of the water.

EXT. WASTE DUMP SITE - NIGHT (RESUMING)

Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, each carrying
several bags of fat.  One of Jack's bags gets caught on the
barbed wire and rips, spilling the goo all down the fence. 
Jack's pants and shoes get covered; he slips and slides. 
Tyler starts laughing.  Jack starts laughing.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (RESUMING)

Tyler shows Jack two pots which have a skinned-over layer.

TYLER

When the tallow separates, there
will be a clear layer on top.  It's
glycerin.  We can mix it back in
when we make the soap.

EXT. WASTE DUMP SITE - NIGHT (RESUMING)

Tyler helps Jack over the fence.  They both fall to the ground
on the other side, laughing.  They try to get up and they
both slip in fat, falling on their asses.  They laugh louder. 
FOOTSTEPS; FLASHLIGHT.

Still hysterically laughing, they both get up, slide and
fall down again, get up yet again and stagger away,
disappearing around a corner.

INT. TAXICAB - MOMENTS LATER

Jack and Tyler, slimed with fat, hold their bags, giggling. 
The CAB DRIVER gives them a deadpan look.

67.

END OVERLAPPING INTERCUT.  CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT

Tyler and Jack have fat stains and rips on their clothes
from the waste dump.  The pots boil.  Tyler stirs.  He sticks
a spoon into a pot and lifts up a scoop of the glycerin layer. 
Then, he grabs a can, opens, it.

TYLER

Lye -- the crucial ingredient for
making soap.  A paste of lye and
water can burn through an aluminum
pan.  A solution of lye and water
will dissolve a wooden spoon. 
Combined with water, lye heats to
over two hundred degrees.

Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet.  He takes
Jack's hand and KISSES the back of it.  The saliva shines in
the shape of the kiss.

Tyler poises the can of lye over Jack's hand.

TYLER (CONT'D)

This is a chemical burn, and it will
hurt more than you've ever been
burned.

Tyler pours a bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand.  Jack's
whole body JERKS.  Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand.  Tears
well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens.

Look at your hand.

TYLER (CONT'D)

Jack looks at the burn is swollen glossy in the shape of
Tyler's kiss.

Jack's face spasms, but he forces himself to endure it.

JACK (V.O.)

Tyler's kiss was a bonfire or a
branding iron on my hand at the end
of a long, long road I pictured miles
away from me.

Jack takes his gaze off his hand and his eyes become glazed
and detached.

Come back to the pain.

TYLER

68.

JACK (V.O.)

Guided meditation worked for cancer
it could work for this.

Don't shut this out.

TYLER

JACK (V.O.)

I didn't think of the words "pain"
or "searing flesh".  I was going to
my cave to find my power animal.

Quick CUT TO:

INT. CAVE

Marla, looking beautiful in a stunning black dress.

As soon as Tyler speaks, we CUT BACK TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Tyler squeezing Jack's hand.  Jack's eyes re-focus on Tyler.

TYLER

This is the greatest moment of your
life and you're off somewhere, missing
it.  Listen.  Your father was your
model for God.  And if your father
bails out, what does that tell you
about God?

Jack's face spasms in pain.  He keeps his attention on Tyler.

TYLER (CONT'D)

You have to consider the possibility
that God doesn't like you.  He hates
you.  This is not the worst thing
that can happen.  His hate is better
that His indifference.

Jack becomes dazed again.  CUT TO:

INT. CAVE

Marla drops to the ground and pulls Jack on top of her. 
Jack moves to kiss her. 

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Tyler tugs at Jack's arm.

TYLER

We are God's middle children, with
no special place in history and no
special attention.  Unless we get
God's attention, we have no hope of
damnation or redemption.

69.

Jack looks at Tyler and they lock eyes in a stare.

TYLER (CONT'D)

The lower you fall, the higher you
fly.  The farther you run, the more
God wants you back.

Jack does his best to stifle his spasms and quivers of pain. 
Tears drip from his eyes.

TYLER (CONT'D)

Someday, you will die.  And until
you know that, you're useless to me.

Tyler's eyes fill with tears and he smiles.  Suddenly, Jack
starts breathing heavily and he shakes his hand.

Fuck, man.  This HURTS.

JACK

Tyler laughs; Jack, bearing the pain, cracks a weird little
crooked smiles, his eyes wide.

INT. KITCHEN - SUNRISE

Tyler watches as Jack cuts several perfectly shaped bars of
soap.

Tyler finishes wrapping one.  The wrapper says: "The Paper
Street Soap Company" in quaint writing.

INT. BARNEY'S - DAY

Jack and Tyler, wearing trenchcoats and looking like death-
warmed-over, wait by a counter and trendily-dressed and finely-
coiffed SALESPEOPLE zip around.  Tyler is the picture of
cool.  Jack looks around as if expecting to get arrested. 
He looks at his BANDAGED HAND, shakes it.

A BUYER, a woman, comes to the counter, smiles at Tyler; he
smiles back.  MOS while Jack's VOICE is OVER the following: 
the Buyer looks over a sample bar of soap.  She nods, smiles
and begins to fill out forms.

JACK (V.O.)

Tyler sold it to the stores at twenty
bucks a bar.  God knows what they
charged.  We were selling rich women
their own fat back to them.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Jack and Tyler march down the sidewalk, full of purpose,
like gunfighters heading for a show-down.

70.

TYLER

Look at the guys in fight club.  The
strongest and smartest men who have
ever lived -- and they're pumping
gas and waiting tables; or they're
slaves with white collars. 
Advertising has them chasing cars
and clothes.  A whole generation
working in jobs they hate, just so
they can buy shit they don't really
need.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - NIGHT

MEN are entering the gymnasium for the testicular cancer
support group "Remaining Men Together".  Bob starts to file
in with the rest, and suddenly, Jack darts forth from the
shadows and blocks his way.

Hi.

Hi, Bob.

BOB

JACK

Bob tries to go through the door, but Jack blocks him.

Are you really a man?

JACK (CONT'D)

Yes ... we all are.

BOB

JACK
I'm not so sure.

Jack forcefully pushes Bob.  Caught off-guard, he backs into
a locker with a bang.  Jack slaps Bob's face.

JACK (CONT'D)

Come on, you big moose.  Let's see
if you are.

Jack punches Bob in the stomach.  Bob puts up his hands to
block.  Jack throws more punches.  Finally, Bob punches Jack
in the face, knocking him staggering.  Jack comes back and
they pummel each other.  Bob's face gets redder with anger.

Then, Jack steps back, holding out his hands to signal "stop".

Let's take this somewhere else.

JACK (CONT'D)

71.

INT. BASEMENT - ELECTRONICS WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The crowd screams insanely as Bob and Jack go at it in the
circle of light.  Bob's eyes are wild with glee.

EXT. BASEMENT DOOR - ELECTRONICS WAREHOUSE - LATER

Everyone quietly sneaks out of the new location -- we've
seen none of these guys before -- this is a new chapter. 
Jack and Bob stagger out last.  They are both dripping blood
and covered with bruises -- Jack being in worse shape -- and
they both grin with religious serenity.

Bob hugs Jack.

Thank you.  Thank you.

BOB

Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a sack,
enervated from the beating he took.

You're welcome.

JACK

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Fight club -- this was mine and
Tyler's gift -- our gift to the world.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Ricky grapples with a YUPPIE.  They fall to the sidewalk,
pounding each other.

YUPPIE

WHO ARE YOU?!  WHY DID YOU ATTACK
ME?!

The Yuppie maneuvers Ricky toward a metal fence and insanely
tries to impale him on a spike.  Tyler and Jack shoot INTO
VIEW and grab the YUPPIE, laughing.

WHO ARE *YOU*!!

YUPPIE (CONT'D)

INT. TRUCK GARAGE - NIGHT

Ricky and the Yuppie fight each other while the crowd --
still even more new guys -- cheers.

JACK (V.O.)

We started a fight club for every
night of the week.

CLOSE UP - BUMPERSTICKER

Which reads: "DRUNK DRIVERS AGAINST MOTHERS".

72.

A HAND presses it down in all corners.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL -
the bumper, THEN the whole car -- a luxury sedan.  THEN -
the entire PARKING STRUCTURE wherein ALL the bumpers have
the sticker.

We started pulling pranks.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT

Jack, Tyler and Ricky quickly paste up a basic, black-on-
white-lettering BILLBOARD.  It says: "DID YOU KNOW ... ? 
YOU

CAN USE YOUR OLD MOTOR OIL TO FERTILIZE YOUR LAWN! --
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY".

TYLER

We're the middle children of history,
with no special purpose or place.

We don't have a great war in our generation, or a great
depression.

The great depression is our lives.  The great war is a
spiritual war.

EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY

Jack and Bob, armed with a toolbox, change the "Enter" and
"Exit" signs around.  They walk away.  In the background, a
car drives into the "entrance" and the front tires EXPLODE
from the BLADES in the ground.

EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Jack walks toward an intersection, beyond which is a large
CITY PARK.

A group of people are LEAVING A PUBLIC BUILDING in front of
him.  Marla is among them -- it's a support group adjourning
for the night.  Jack catches Marla's eye.  He simply smiles
and waves.  Marla stares at him, deadpan.  She turns and
walks away, JUST AS ...

Tyler STEPS INTO FRAME, looking straight ahead at the park. 
He signals Jack and they move forward.  From out of nowhere,
Bob joins them.

EXT. PARK - OUTDOOR BEER FESTIVAL - NIGHT

A bad BAND plays German music.  BANNERS advertising American
beer are everywhere.  People wear shirts and hats with beer
ads.  Jack, Bob and Tyler sneak up to the side of a portable
TOILET.  They shove it until it falls against the next toilet. 
An ENTIRE ROW of portable toilets falls like dominoes.  They
dart behind a row of trees, then casually walk away.

73.

JACK (V.O.)

We were raised by television to
believe that someday we'll all be
millionaires and movie stars and
rock stars -- but we won't.  And
we're learning that fact.

And we're very, *very* pissed-off.

TYLER

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - ON GROUND - DAY

Two AIRPLANE MAINTENANCE MEN -- with bruised faces -- rip
open a box from a PRINT SHOP.  They dig up handfuls of AIRLINE
SAFETY INSTRUCTION CARDS and begin to inset them into each
seat back pouch.  We MOVE IN and SEE a card -- it shows
passengers SCREAMING and FLAILING ABOUT IN

TERROR.

INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Jack, dressed for work, receives a sheet of paper from Tyler.

TYLER

Make two dozen copies.  We're going
to have --

INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY

Jack stands over a copy machine, getting hit by the flashes
of light.

JACK (V.O.)

-- more than one fight club on every
night of the week.

Jack looks around.  Other faces illuminated in FLASHES. 
HALF of them are bruised.  He smiles, his eyelids getting
heavy and his head nodding.

INT. JACK'S OFFICE - LATER

Jack sits in his cubicle, playing a game on his computer. 
Boss enters.

JACK (V.O.)

He was wearing a yellow tie.  It
must be Thursday.  I didn't even
wear a tie to work anymore.

Boss slaps a piece of paper down on Jack's desk.

BOSS

"The first rule of fight club is you
don't talk about fight club".

Jack stares at him stoically.

74.

JACK (V.O.)

I was still half-asleep all the time. 
I left the original in the copy
machine.

BOSS

Is this yours?  "The second rule of
fight club is you don't talk about
fight club".  Is it yours or not? 
You don't get paid to abuse the copy
machine.

JACK

"Abuse" the copy machine.  What an
image.

BOSS

Let's play pretend.  You're me.  You
find *this*.  What would you do? 
Hmm?  Make a managerial decision. 
What would you do?

Jack slowly rises, walks softly to his office door, shuts it
and faces the boss.

JACK

I'd be very careful who I talked to
about this.  It sounds like someone
dangerous wrote this, and this
buttoned-down psychotic could probably
snap at any moment and stalk from
office to office with an Armalite AR-
180 Carbine gas-operated
semiautomatic.  He's probably at
home every night with a little rattail
file, filing a cross into the tip of
every one of his bullets.  This way,
when he pumps a round into ...
*someone* ... it will split along
the filed grooves and spread open
the way a dum dum flowers inside you
to blow a load of guts out through
*someone's* spine.  This is probably
somebody you've know for years.

Boss stares at him with a tinge of outrage, a tinge of fear.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Tyler's words.  Me clowning around. 
And I used to be such a nice person.

Jack's phone RINGS.  Jack answers.

JACK (CONT'D)
Compliance and Liability.

75.

My tit's going to rot off.

MARLA'S VOICE

JACK (TO BOSS; BIG SMILE)

Could you excuse me?  I need to take this call.

Boss goes to the office door opens it, stares at Jack a beat,
then leaves.

JACK
(into phone)

What are you talking about?

INTERCUT WITH

CLOSE-UP OF MARLA

In dim light, her face very pretty with make-up.

MARLA

I need you to check and see if there's
a lump on my breast.  I can't afford
to blow the cash on a doctor just to
find out.

JACK
I don't know ...

You're the only one I can turn to.

MARLA

JACK (V.O.)

She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral
in her book.

Meet me at work.

MARLA

EXT. MORTUARY - LATE AFTERNOON

Jack goes through the front door.

INT. MORTUARY - SAME

Jack walks into the dim, dramatically-lit foyer.  He sees
Marla at a

desk.  She does not see him.  She's wearing a black formal
dress --

like a gorgeous angel of death.  A VERY FAT MALE CUSTOMER
holds an URN the size of an egg cup.  Marla studies the urn
and the Customer's body with a dreary expression.

MARLA

Sir, you couldn't get the ashes of
your *neck* in here.

The Customer turns and stomps out the door.  Jack steps
forward to the desk.

76.

Employee of the month?

JACK

Marla looks up at him and smiles.

EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET

Jack watches as Marla takes two boxes from a van with sign
"MEALS ON WHEELS".

INT. MARLA'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Marla leads Jack inside.

JACK

You know, this is a sweet side of
you.

Think so?

MARLA

JACK

Picking these up for ...

(reads off boxes:)

"Mrs. Haniver" and ... "Mrs. Raines". 
Where are they?  Top floor?

MARLA

They're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in
poverty.  You want any of this?

No, thanks.

Good.

JACK

MARLA

He stares at her while she wolfs down food.  Marla takes a
napkin and wipes her mouth.

MARLA (CONT'D)

This napkin is "one-hundred percent
recycled".  So is my toilet paper.

Can you imagine.  The worst job in the world -- recycling
toilet paper.

INT. MARLA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Marla stands in front of a mirror with her shirt open.  Jack
stands behind her with his hand on the bottom side of her
breast.  Her hand guides his.

77.

Where?  Here?

JACK

Here.

There?

Here.

Here.

MARLA

JACK

MARLA

JACK

Feel anything?

MARLA

No.

JACK

Jack's head is behind Marla's.  His eyes close.  Both of
them speak more slowly, softer.

Make sure.

MARLA

Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.

JACK

MARLA
You feel nothing?

Nothing.

JACK

He almost kisses her neck.  Marla turns around, faces him
and begins to slowly button up her shirt.

Whew.  That's a relief.  Thanks.

MARLA

No problem.

JACK

I wish I could return the favor.

MARLA

Jack touches his breasts, shakes his head.

78.

I think everything's okay here.

JACK

I could check your prostate.

MARLA

Uh ... nah.

JACK

Well, thanks.

MARLA

Marla kisses him -- and lingers for a bit longer than just
friendly.

Jack pulls away.

Are we done?

JACK

I gotta go.

JACK (CONT'D)

Marla's voice turns acid:

MARLA

Yeah, we're done.  Get the fuck outta
here.

Jack goes to her door, opens it, looks back at her.

I'm sorry.

JACK

GO, ASSHOLE!

MARLA

EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Jack walks down the sidewalk.  He glances back up at Marla's
window as he crosses the street.  He sees her.  She moves
away from the window and -- Jack's BUMPED -- very lightly --
by a PASSERBY -- it's *Tyler*.

What are you doing?

TYLER

JACK

Uh ... I ... was ... coming back
from ... a ... thing ...

Tyler throws an arm around Jack and leads him down the
sidewalk.

We need to talk.

TYLER

INT. BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY

Jack steps into the open doorway and lightly knocks against
the frame.

Boss looks up from his large, expensive desk.

79.

JACK
We need to talk.

BOSS

Okay.  Where to begin?  With your
constant absenteeism?  With your
unpresentable appearance?  I might
as well tell you now -- you're going
to be put up for review.

THIS NEXT LINE *NOT* IN V.O.:

I Am Joe's Complete Lack Of Surprise.

JACK

Boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.

JACK (CONT'D)

Let's pretend.  You're the Department
of Transportation.  And you knew
that our company intentionally left
a front seat mounting bracket that
never passed collision tests?  Did
nothing about leather seats -- that
were cured in third world countries
with a chemical we know causes birth
defects?  Brake linings that fail
after a thousand miles.

Turbochargers that blow up and cut off legs at the knees. 
Fuel injectors that burn people alive.  All of these accidents
where "cause of failure" is stamped "unknown".  I know where
the bodies are buried.

Call it job security.

BOSS

Just who the fuck do you think you
are?!  Get out of here!  You're fired!

JACK

I've got a better idea.  You're going
to keep me on payroll as an outside
consultant.  In exchange for my
salary, I'll perform the task of not
telling anyone what I know.  I won't
need to come into the office.  I can
do this job from home.  Call it early
retirement, with pension.

Boss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage.

80.

JACK (CONT'D)

Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and
this whole fucking world, but I'm
your responsibility.

Jack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose.  Blood starts to trickle
down.  He punches himself in the jaw, harder.  He throws
himself back, acting as if the force of the punch knocked
him.  His back SLAMS against a framed painting and SHATTERS
the glass.  He and the frame and the glass and the painting
fall to the floor.

I Am Joe's Smirking Revenge.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Please don't hit me again.  Please.

JACK (CONT'D)

Jack gets back to his feet and punches himself in the stomach,
then punches himself in the jaw again.  He reels backwards
and falls into a hanging shelf, ripping it off the wall,
sending it's contents flying.

He falls to the floor again.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
For some reason, I thought of my
first fight -- with Tyler.

Jack crawls along the carpet toward Boss, dripping blood. 
He tries to keep up the act, but he sporadically GIGGLES. 
He grabs Boss's leg.

JACK (CONT'D)

Please ... give me the paychecks
like I asked for.  You won't see me
again.  You won't have any trouble.

Jack climbs up Boss's leg.  Boss, aghast, tries to shake him
off, and, in doing so, stumbles back in to his desk, knocking
off photos, stacks of paper, paperweights.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Under and behind and inside everything
this man took for granted, something
horrible had been growing.

Jack crawls up high enough to grab Boss's belt and hoist
himself up further.  He's getting blood all over the Boss's
clothes.  Jack SMUDGES blood from his face onto the knuckles
of both Boss's hands.  The horrified man SCREAMS.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

And right then, at our most excellent
moment, security guards decided to
walk in.

81.

Two SECURITY GUARDS come inside and gape at the sight.  Behind
them stands a crowd of curious workers, also taking in the
sight.

Please don't hit me again.

JACK (gurgling blood) (CONT'D)

INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - JACK'S ROOM - DUSK

Jack, all bloody, lies in his bed, asleep.  He awakens,
hearing the BACK DOOR SLAM.  He painfully hauls himself out
of bed.

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Jack enters to see Tyler taking beers out of the fridge. 
Jack waves a

PAYCHECK.

I did it.

JACK

That's fucking great!

TYLER

Jack sees that Tyler is dressed in combat fatigues.  He's
splattered with various colors of PAINT.  There's a rope and
rappelling mechanisms lying on the table.

Tyler nods toward the living room and hands Jack all the
beers.

Go on in.  We're celebrating.

TYLER (CONT'D)

INT. LIVING ROOM

Jack, a little bewildered, saunters in, carrying the beers. 
Tyler does NOT follow him.  Bob, Ricky and several fight
club guys are in front of the TV.  They are all dressed like
Tyler, all splattered with paint.

Jack hands them their beer.  One of the guys is sixteen year
old with an angelic face.  He notices the TV.

SHHH!  They're back to it!

ANGEL FACE

Jack looks at the TV as it shows a LIVE shot of a BUILDING,
which is identified at the bottom of the screen as the TRW
building.  It has a GIANT GRINNING FACE PAINTED on it.

The two EYES are broken, charred windows with SMOKE pouring
out.  Firetrucks spray water into the windows.

82.

REPORTER

Police Commissioner Jacobs has come
down ... just a second ... excuse
me, could you tell us what you think
this is?

The COMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled man with baleful eyes,
turns to camera.

COMMISSIONER JACOBS

We believe this is related to the
other recent acts of vandalism around
the city.  It's some kind of organized
group.  And we're investigating
thoroughly.

Jack turns back and sees Tyler in the archway, watching the
TV.  Tyler pulls back, out of sight.  Jack turns to the
others.

What did you guys do?

JACK

They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER, look at Jack and shake their
heads.  Jack just stares at them.  Suddenly, the guys' faces
turn to stone.

BOB

The first rule of Project Mayhem is --
you don't ask questions.

Jack stares at them.  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

A loud, luxurious banquet ensues.  Commissioner Jacobs guzzles
champagne and puffs on a cigar.  Jack, in a waiter's uniform,
serving another table, stares at Jacobs.  Then, Jack looks
apprehensively

toward certain other waiters:  Tyler, Bob, Ricky and Angel
Face --

mixed in with the mass of waiters.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME

Commissioner Jacobs enters, puffing the cigar, and walks
toward a urinal.  Jack, Tyler, Bob and Ricky leap out of the
corner and attack him.  Jack's heart isn't in it -- he barely
helps the others.  Tyler knocks the cigar out of Jacob's
mouth and slaps a piece of tape over it.

INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - SAME

Jack holds the door while the others drag the struggling
Commissioner inside.  They hold him down and pull down his
pants.  Bob snaps a rubber band, then reaches down to
Commissioner Jacob's crotch.

83.

TYLER

Wrap it around the top of his ball
sac.

Ricky holds a knife to Commissioner Jacob's testicles.  Jack,
red-faced, keeps his distance.  Tyler leans in and whispers
in the frightened man's ear.

TYLER (CONT'D)

You're not going to continue your
"rigorous investigation".  You're
going to publicly state that there
is no underground group.  Or --

imagine, the rest of your life with your ball sac flapping
empty.

No.  Please.  Stop.  Please.

COMMISSIONER JACOBS

TYLER

One to the *New York Times* and one
to the *Los Angeles Times*.  Press
release style.  Remember this.  The
people you're after are everyone you
depend on.  We're the people who do
your laundry and cook your food and
serve your dinner.  We guard you
while you sleep.  We drive the
ambulances.  We process your insurance
claims.  We control every part of
your life.  So don't fuck with us.

Ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife -- he holds up the
severed

RUBBER BAND.

EXT. HOTEL - LATER

Jack, Tyler and the others file quickly out the back service
entrance.

Tyler slaps Angel Face's back.  Angel Face smiles at him. 
Everyone splits up in different directions.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

Fight club in full swing.  Jack squares off with Angel Face. 
He BEATS the SHIT out of Angel Face with a viciousness

84.

heretofore unseen.  The crowd shouts maniacally, save for
Tyler, who watches with an inscrutable stone face.

Angel Face tries to speak, but Jack pounds him too hard. 
Blood flies everywhere.  The crowd becomes QUIETER.  Finally,
Angel Face, on the floor, is clearly unconscious.  Jack stops,
stares at him, numb.  The crowd seems a little spooked. 
Tyler scans the faces, looks at Jack.

EXT. STREET - LATER

Tyler and Jack walk through pools of streetlight.

JACK

I felt like destroying something
beautiful.

Excellent.

TYLER

An idling car HONKS.  Tyler leads Jack toward it.  A bruise-
faced VALET PARKER throws keys to Tyler.

There you go, Mr. Durden.

VALET

After you, *Mr. Durden*.

JACK

INT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - LATER

RAIN GUSHES down.  Tyler drives.  Jack sits slumped in the
passenger seat.  They are BARRELING down a two-lane HIGHWAY,
intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights.  Jack
stews in silence.  Tyler glances at him.

What's the problem?

TYLER

JACK

Nothing.  Why wasn't I told about
"Project Mayhem"?

You *were* told about it.

TYLER

JACK

Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Fine.  If you can't
talk to me about it ...

TYLER

That's the whole point -- you *don't*
talk about it.

So, I can't even ask?

JACK

85.

TYLER

What do you want me to say?  That
Project Mayhem will knock over the
pillars of civilization like dominoes? 
That it's going to bring about a
prematurely-induced dark age?  Should
I E-mail you?  Should I put this on
your "action item list"?

Fine.

JACK

TYLER

Recognize the make and model of this
car?

JACK
Yeah -- so what?

TYLER

The front seat mounting bracket never
passed collision tests.

Tyler pulls the car into the opposite lane.  HEADLIGHTS in
the distance get closer very, very quickly.

What are you doing?!

JACK

The oncoming car gets closer and closer, honking and flashing
it's lights.  Jack tries to grab the wheel.  Tyler uses one
arm to pin down Jack's arms.  He uses one hand to steer.

TYLER!  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!!

JACK (CONT'D)

TYLER

If you died right now, how would you
feel about your life?

JACK

I WOULD FEEL NOTHING ABOUT MY LIFE! 
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR?!

I want to hear the truth.

TYLER

The car swerves at the last second.

JACK

Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club! 
Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick
of this shit!  How's that?  Huh?

TYLER

You don't have any concept of what
it is to hit bottom.

An oncoming TRUCK honks and flashes it's lights.  It moves
to the other side of the road.  Tyler steers there, too. 
The truck moves back; Tyler moves back.  More honking and
flashing.  The truck moves; Tyler moves.

86.

TYLER (CONT'D)

HITTING BOTTOM ISN'T A WEEKEND
RETREAT!  IT'S NOT A SEMINAR!  ONLY
AFTER YOU'VE LOST EVERYTHING ARE YOU
FREE TO DO ANYTHING!  YOU SEE, YOU
LISTEN, BUT YOU DON'T GET IT!  YOU
HAVE TO FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW,
EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW!

Just seconds to impact with the oncoming truck and -- Tyler
swerves.

Now the car heads straight for a STALLED CAR on the side of
the road, surrounded by flares.  Jack stops struggling to
get his arms free.

JACK

I am nothing in the world compared
to you.  I am helpless.  I am stupid
and weak and all I do is want and
need things.  I *am* my little shit
job.  I *am* my condo and my Swedish
furniture.  I am SHIT!

Tyler lets go of Jack's arms and lets go of the steering
wheel.  He and Jack look at each other as their car barrels
toward the stalled car.

Their faces are illuminated by the light of the flares.

They SMASH into the stalled car.  Both airbags inflate, but
the front seat LURCHES forward, loose, causing the men's
legs to bang against the dash.  Tremendous momentum makes
the back of the car whip around and carry it into a ass-over-
teakettle ROLL down the hill.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I'd never been in a car accident. 
This was what all those statistics
felt like before I wrote them into
my reports.

INT. FAMILY CAR (JACK'S IMAGINATION)

The car that Jack saw, post-wreck, in the warehouse, FLAMING,
tumbling END over END; the FATHER, MOTHER TEENAGE GIRL and
BABY all SCREAMING.

INT. TYLER'S STOLEN CAR - RESUMING

The hill goes on further and further -- it's a deep RAVINE. 
The car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof.

87.

EXT. OVERTURNED CAR

Tyler crawls out and goes around, opening Jack's door.  He
drags Jack out into the mud.  He grabs Jack's face and
squeezes it, shaking it.

You just had a near-life experience.

TYLER

INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.  Tyler sits in a
chair, next to the bed, speaking softly.

TYLER

The world I see -- you're stalking
elk through the damp canyon forests
around the ruins of Rockefeller
Center.  You wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your
life.  You climb the wrist-thick
vines that wrap the Sears Tower. 
You see tiny figures pounding corn
and laying strips of venison on the
empty car pool lane of the ruins of
a superhighway.

INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - DAWN

Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.  Tyler is gone. 
Faint sounds of SAWING and HAMMERING.

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Jack sits at the table, sipping coffee.  He's pale, dazed. 
He seems broken.  He hears the faint sounds of sawing and
hammering again; he's unsure of where they're coming from. 
He glances out the window, sees nothing.

Marla walks into the kitchen.  Jack looks up at her.  She
looks at him, unsmiling.  There's a bruise on her face and
arm.  She pours herself a coffee and lights a cigarette.  A
beat of silence, then:

I'll be out of your way in a sec.

MARLA

She seems to be as weak as Jack.

You ... don't have to ... rush off.

JACK

Sarcastic prick.

MARLA

No, really ...

JACK

Marla's eyes drift away from his.  Jack gets up, tries to
move closer to her.  She pulls away.  He retreats and they
wind up on opposite sides of the room.  Jack leans against
the wall near the BASEMENT DOOR, which is AJAR.

88.

JACK (CONT'D)

Why are we both ... caught up like
this ... with ...?

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I came so close to saying Tyler's
name, I could feel it vibrate inside
my mouth.

Marla looks at him curiously, waiting.

JACK (CONT'D)

Why does a weak person go out and
find a strong person to ... hang
onto?

MARLA

It's a real sick relationship.  You
don't think I know it?

Does it *have* to be?

JACK

Does it?

MARLA

Faint sound of sawing and hammering.  Jack can't quite figure
where it's coming from.

You hear that?

JACK

Hear what?

MARLA

That ... sawing and hammering.

JACK

MARLA

We have to change the subject?  Have
we been talking too long?

JACK

I just don't understand what you get
out of such a sick relationship.

MARLA

What the hell do *you* get out of
it?

Jack turns and sees, through the slim space of the open door,
Tyler, at the bottom of the basement stairs, staring a silent
warning.  Jack turns back to Marla.

89.

Nevermind.

JACK

MARLA

No.  That day you came over to check
my breast ...

Let's just stop right here.

JACK

MARLA

Come on!  You *want* to pull yourself
out of whatever you're stuck in.

Marla moves slowly toward Jack.

Conversation over.

JACK

Marla strokes Jack's hair.  She sees the kiss-scar on his
hand.  She grabs his hand and studies it.  Jack tries to
pull it back, but Marla keeps a tight grip.

What is that?!  Who did that?!

MARLA

... A person.

JACK

Guy or girl?

MARLA

JACK

Why would you ask if it's a guy or a
girl?!

Why would you get bent if I asked?!

MARLA

Go.

JACK

MARLA

What does it mean?  You're afraid to
say?

Go!  Go!

JACK

Marla kisses Jack's hand, putting her lips right onto the
scar, leaving an imprint of lipstick.  Jack jerks his hand
away from her.  He tries to wipe off the lipstick and it
smears.  He unconsciously licks it off.

90.

MMMMMMMMMM ... Swallow it.

MARLA

Get the hell out of here!

JACK

Stung, Marla stomps toward the back door.

MARLA

Go fuck yourself -- that's probably
how you like it best.

And out she goes.  Jack watches her stomp through the backyard
and out to the sidewalk.  Tyler comes up from the basement,
passes Jack and goes through the archway.  Sound of his
footsteps going up to the second floor.  Jack goes down the
basement steps.

INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

TRIPLE-DECKER BUNKS clutter the basement, as many as can fit
into the space.

JACK
What's this for?

>From upstairs, the sound of the DOORBELL.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jack opens the door.  Ricky stands on the porch, staring
blankly ahead in subordinate military style.  He's dressed
in black pants, black shirt, black shoes.  He holds a brown
paper bag.  An army surplus mattress sits in a tied-up roll
at his feet.

Jack is about to say something, when Tyler steps past Jack
and speaks very softly to Ricky:

TYLER

I'm sorry.  You're too young to train
here.

Tyler steps back inside and shuts the door.

"Train" here?

JACK

TYLER

He's not.  If the applicant is young,
we tell him he's too young.  Old,
too old.  Fat, too fat.

Why?

JACK

91.

TYLER

This is how Buddhist temples tested
applicants going back for bah-zillion
years.  If the applicant waits at
the door for three days without food,
shelter or encouragement, then he
can enter and begin training.

Begin training?

JACK

Tyler grins at him.

EXT. PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

Jack bursts out the door, faces Ricky.

JACK

GET OUT OF HERE!  GO!  HE TOLD YOU
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG!  GET OUT!

It's clear there will be no response from Ricky, who's like
a statue.

Jack goes back inside, closes the door.

EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

Ricky stands in the same spot.  Jack bursts out with a broom,
knocks the brown paper bag out of Ricky's hand, kicks it off
the porch.  Ricky remains in place, motionless.

JACK

ARE YOU STUPID?!  I TOLD YOU TO GET
OUT OF HERE!  YOU'RE NEVER GETTING
INSIDE THIS HOUSE!

EXT. PORCH - MORNING

Ricky in the same spot.  Tyler slinks out the front door,
smiling.

TYLER

I'm sorry about the misunderstanding. 
Look, friend, it's not the end of
the world.  Just go away.  Nothing
personal, but I'm going to have to
call the police.  You're trespassing.

EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

Ricky, same spot.  Jack bursts outside with the broom again. 
He WHACKS Ricky in the shoulder.

JACK

YOU'RE NEVER GETTING THROUGH THIS
FUCKING DOOR, YOU STUPID LITTLE
WEASEL!!

92.

INT. JACK'S ROOM - LATER

Jack drinks a beer, smokes a cigarette and stares down at
the PORCH, which he can see from a sideward//downward angle. 
Ricky stands in the same spot.

JACK (V.O.)

Sooner or later, we all just became
what Tyler wanted us to be.

EXT. PORCH - MORNING

Ricky's in the same spot.  Next to him now is Bob, dressed
in black with brown paper bag and Army surplus mattress. 
Tyler steps out the front door.  Jack lights in the doorway,
locking eyes on Bob.

TYLER (to Ricky)

Get your stuff.

(to Bob)

You're too old to train here.  Sorry.

Tyler and Ricky go inside and Tyler slams the door.

INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - LATER

Jack stands in the open bathroom doorway, watching Tyler
SHAVE off all of Ricky's HAIR.  When he's done, Tyler gives
the top of Ricky's head a sharp slap.

TYLER

A monkey, ready to be shot up into
space, ready to sacrifice himself
for Project Mayhem.

And, so, all those with shaved heads will henceforth be termed
"SPACE

MONKEYS".

EXT. PORCH - LATER

Jack looks out the window.  Bob continues to stand,
motionless.  Ricky comes out the front door with the broom.

RICKY

YOU'RE TOO FUCKING OLD!  GET OUT OF
HERE!

Ricky WHACKS Bob with the broom several times, then goes
back inside,

93.

SLAMMING THE DOOR.  CUT TO:

EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

CLOSE ON JACK'S FACE, staring out the window.

YOU'RE TOO SKINNY!  GET OUT OF HERE!

VOICE

FULL BACK TO REVEAL a SPACE MONKEY we've never seen before,
with the shaved head, whacking a SKINNY APPLICANT with the
broom.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

Jack pulls back from the window.  SPACE MONKEYS, all dressed
in black, all with shaved heads, are ALL OVER THE PLACE. 
There are tables set up for them to wrap bars of soap.  Jack
lopes into the

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Where Space Monkeys render fat and make soap.  Several, off
to the side, stir a large vat of RICE.  One of them recites
a memorized statement:

FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY

"You are not a beautiful and unique
snowflake.  You are the same decaying
organic matter as everything else. 
We are all part of the same compost
pile."

JACK (V.O.)

Planet Tyler Jack dips a spoon into
the rice vat and chomps on some rice
in an irritable way.

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

It could be worse.  I could get hit
by lightning and my head could burn
down to a smoldering baseball and my
zipper could weld shut.

HE MOVES BACK OUT TO THE

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

And tromps up the steps to the 2nd floor landing.

INT. TYLER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jack enters.  Bob reads a book and makes marks on a chart. 
All along the floor are baskets; each one is labeled with a
number in sequence:

94.

"1, 2," etc.  The first ten are under a sign that says
"WILMINGTON".

Then, there's a sign over some that says "NEW YORK", then
"CHICAGO", and other cities.  There are dozens of BOOKS on
FINANCE.  Jack looks in basket number "1" and sees the word
"CITIBANK" at the top of a page.

He starts flipping through it; then the next basket.

Bob grabs Jack's hand and leads him away from the baskets.

BOB

The first rule of Project Mayhem is
you don't ask questions.

JACK

This is me, Bob.  Tyler's been gone
for over a week.  What the hell is
going on?

BOB

The first rule of Project Mayhem is
you --

Right.

JACK

Jack leaves the room.

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Jack barges in among the laboring Space Monkeys.  They pinch
herbs into the soap mix.  They also use vodka.  Jack grabs a
bottle of vodka and takes a long pull off it.

JACK (V.O.)

I had to hug the walls, being a mouse
trapped inside this clockwork of
space monkeys, cooking and working
and sleeping in teams.  The house
became a living thing, wet on the
inside from so many people sweating
and breathing.  So many people moving,
the house moved.

The PHONE RINGS.  Jack snatches it.  All the Monkeys stare
at him.

Project Mayhem.

JACK (CONT'D)

Don't answer the phone like that.

TYLER'S VOICE

Jack turns away from the others, moves to a corner, talks
sotto voce.

95.

Tyler!  Where have you been?

JACK

Don't ask questions.

TYLER'S VOICE

There's a tense pause.

JACK (V.O.)

I Am Joe's Broken Heart because Tyler
dumped me.  Because I'm just another
cog ...

Be quiet and listen.

TYLER'S VOICE

Jack reacts with surprise -- did Tyler hear his thoughts?

TYLER'S VOICE (CONT'D)

I'll tell you everything when I get
back.  Right now, you gotta do
something for me.

Me?  When?

JACK

Tonight.

TYLER'S VOICE

EXT. FRONT PORCH - LATER

Jack, Bob, and two other Space Monkeys step out the front
door, laden with boxes and equipment.

SKINNY SPACE MONKEY

"We are the all-singing, all-dancing
crap of the world".

The group of four steps off the porch and heads for a VAN.

EXT. PARK - NIGHT

A piece of ART adorns the top of a hill: a metal TOWER, wide
at the base and a hundred feet high, in design somewhat
similar to the Eifel Tower.  At the top is a giant GLOBE
made of circular poles and wires.

Jack, Bob and the other two monkeys attach the explosive
packets to the globe; wire the packets together; use sandbags
to cover the packets.

EXT. PARK - LATER

The group of four huddle behind some bushes, staring at the
globe.  Bob holds a small metal electronic box with a button --
a detonator.  He presses the button.

A RAPID SERIES of EXPLOSIONS runs from the base of the tower
to the top, along the four main structural supports.  They
are contained, shaped blasts.  The tower crumbles straight
down.  Bob turns to smile at Jack.

96.

BOB

Exactly the way it was supposed to
work.

The globe falls free, bangs into the top of the hill and
begins to roll.  When it gets to the street, it bounces onto
the top of a parked LIMO -- and becomes a FLAMING, raised
"GUTTERBALL" -- it never hits the street -- it rolls over
one parked limo or expensive luxury car after another,
crunching the roofs, causing the windows to explode outward.

Fifty cars get this treatment.

Then, it arrives at the lobby of a HOTEL, BROADSIDES a couple
of limos, CAROMS off them, TURNS and rolls directly into the
front of a large

(closed) STARBUCKS, SMASHING DOWN the windows and the front
door and setting the place ON FIRE.

EXT. PARK - AERIAL VIEW

As Jack, Bob and the two other Monkeys FLEE, LAUGHING
hysterically at their handiwork.  They split up and move in
different directions.

MOVE IN ON JACK, sprinting, keeping hidden by bushes.  SIRENS
can be

heard.  He's stripping off his ski mask, his gloves, his
combat gear --

as he runs.  Underneath are street clothes.

JACK (V.O.)

In that moment I "clicked".  I became
what Tyler wanted.  I was his limb,
his appendage -- an extension of his
will, nothing more.  And he knew it. 
I could feel him knowing it.

Jack dumps the wad of clothes into a trashcan and pulls up
the surrounding trash to cover them.  He breaks into a sprint
again, heading for the edge of the park.

GUNSHOT.  Jack's smile fades.  He stops, looks toward the
direction from which the sound came.  He turns, heads down
along a row of hedges.

97.

HE COMES TO A

INT. CONCRETE STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

And moves to the top step, looking down.  A COP is near the
bottom, running down to the sidewalk.  Next to a STREETLAMP
LIES a ONE of the MONKEYS in full combat attire and ski mask. 
The body is MOTIONLESS, SPRAWLED.  In the hand is the
DETONATOR -- looking somewhat like a gun.

The Cop pulls off the ski mask, revealing the DEAD FACE of
Bob, a BULLETHOLE through the head.

Jack flinches backwards as if punched in the stomach.  He
gasps for breath.  The Cop looks up and catches sight of
Jack.  He lifts his gun and his PB radio.  Jack jerks back
out of sight.

EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS

Jack hobbles along.  Nearby, from beyond a hedge, he hears
the crackling of a PB with a VOICE coming from it.  Then:

COP'S VOICE (INTO PB)

Yeah.  We found some clothes.

Jack, sweating like a pig, picks up his pace and heads for
the edge of the park.

EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - NIGHT

Jack, panting, white as a ghost, trembling, approaches from
the sidewalk.  He sees the front door open and four Space
Monkeys come out, carrying LUGGAGE.

BIG-EARED MONKEY (a solemn chant)

We are now the ...

OTHER MONKEYS & BIG-EARED (unison)

... right hands of Tyler Durden.

Jack steps up onto the porch and sees that they are all
holding FLIGHT COUPONS.  Jack notices that all of them have
the KISS-SCAR on their left hands.  They ignore him with
military demeanor and walk down to the sidewalk and head for
the bus stop.

JACK (V.O.)

Under and behind and inside everything
I took for granted, something horrible
had been growing.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jack walks inside to see a Space Monkey, BEET-RED but silent,
holding out his hands while LYE BURNS the inside of the TOPS
of his FINGERS.

Other Monkeys sit and await the process.

98.

JACK (V.O.)

They were using lye to burn off their
fingerprints.

INT. TYLER'S ROOM

Jack barges into the room, goes to the desk and rifles through
drawers.

His elbow bangs against the top of an ANSWERING MACHINE.  It
plays MESSAGES.

MARLA'S VOICE

Look, don't get bent, okay?  But ...
there's a therapist that I think
could really help you.  Give me a
call.  Okay?

Click.  Next message:

DETECTIVE STERN'S VOICE

This is Detective Stern with the
arson unit.  I've called four times
in the last two days.  I need you to
come in for some further questioning.

Jack shivers, snaps OFF the machine, then more furiously
continues his search.  He finally finds flight coupons --
both used and unused.  The used ones have the flight
information, including the destination cities.  He stuffs
all of them into his pocket.

CLOSE SHOT:  SIGN:  "LAGUARDIA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT".

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Jack walks in and sees several MALE PATRONS with FIGHT
BRUISES.  Jack goes to the bar, sidles next to the bruised
men and the BRUISED BARTENDER.  They stare at him.

JACK

This is an emergency.  I'm looking
for Tyler Durden.

Never heard of him.  Sir.

BRUISED PATRON

He and the other bruised patrons and the bartender WINK at
Jack and crack slight smiles.

MONTAGE - DAY & NIGHT:

"WELCOME TO" AIRPORT SIGNS -- Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas,
Phoenix, Los Angeles".

FACES -- bruised, smiling, tight-lipped.

99.

JACK (V.O.)

In every city, I branched out from
the airport to downtown and checked
bars.  There was always a fight club. 
Tyler was setting up franchises, all
over the country.

INT. ANOTHER BAR - NIGHT

Jack walks in and sits at the bar.  The BARTENDER wears a
NECK BRACE and has a black eye.

BARTENDER

Welcome back, Sir.  No one's in here. 
It's always empty the day after fight
club.

JACK

Talk to me.  Have you ever met Tyler
Durden?

Is this a test, Sir?

BARTENDER

Yeah, it's a test.

JACK

BARTENDER

You were in here last Thursday night. 
You were standing right there, asking
me about how good our security is. 
And it's tight as a drum.

Who do you think I am?

JACK

JACK (V.O.) (CONT'D)

Please return your seatbacks to their
full upright and locked position.

BARTENDER

You're the person who did *this* to
me.

The Bartender shows Jack his hand -- it has the kiss-shaped
scar.

You're Tyler Durden, Sir.

BARTENDER (CONT'D)

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Jack bursts inside, runs to the phone, punches a number.  He
doesn't bother to turn on the lamp.

100.

INTERCUT WITH

INT. MARLA'S ROOM - SAME

Marla answers the phone.

Yeah?

MARLA

It's me.  Have we ever had sex?

JACK

MARLA

What kind of stupid question is
that?!!

JACK

Is it stupid because the answer's
"yes" or because the answer's "no"?

Is this a trick?

MARLA

Will you just answer, for God's sake?!

JACK

MARLA

Oh, you mean, you want to know if I
think it was "making love" or just
two animals going at it?

So we *did* make love?

JACK

Is that what *you're* calling it?

MARLA

ANSWER THE QUESTION!!!

JACK

MARLA

You fuck me, then snub me.  You love
me, you hate me, you show your
sensitive side, you turn back into
an asshole!

Oh, God.

JACK

MARLA

Is that a pretty accurate description
of this relationship?

101.

What's my name?

JACK

Tyler Durden.

MARLA

We've just lost cabin pressure.

JACK (V.O.)

I'm coming over.

MARLA

As Marla hangs up, we END INTERCUT.  Jack stares at the
receiver a beat, then realizes ...

Oh, shit!  No!  I'm out of town!

JACK

He punches Marla's number like a maniac.  Listens ... just
ringing and ringing.  He turns, sees TYLER -- sitting on the
bed, staring at him with an ominous poker face.  Jack drops
the receiver.  The room is only lit by dim moonlight through
the window.

You broke your promise.

TYLER

Why do people think I'm you?

JACK

TYLER

Because we happen to share the same
body.

What the hell are you talking about?

JACK

TYLER

Sometimes *I* control it and you
imagine watching me.

INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT (JACK'S MEMORY)

Jack stands near the back of the crowd as Tyler stands in
the middle of the light.

The first rule of fight club is --

TYLER

JUMP CUT - SAME SHOT - (ALTERED FLASHBACK) -- it's JACK in
the light, talking, behaving like TYLER.

-- you don't talk about fight club.

JACK

102.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

Jack gasps and wheezes.  Tyler grins and nods.

JACK
But we fought --

TYLER

When *you're* controlling the body,
you see me and hear me.  But no one
else does.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT (ALTERED FLASHBACK)

Jack sits next to an empty seat and "looks" at the blank air
beside him, eyes focusing on "someone" close.

JACK

What do you do Tyler?

(pause; listens to

reply)

I mean -- for a living.

Jack listens to the reply, then laughs.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

Jack has trouble catching his breath.

JACK

What about when we were together
around other people?

TYLER
You never talked.

EXT. PARK - NIGHT (ALTERED FLASHBACK)

Jack (Tyler) has his face right in front of the Police
Commissioner's.

JACK ("TYLER")

We'll send one ball to the "New York
Times" and one ball to the "Los
Angeles Times".  Sort of press release
style.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

Tyler sits down on the bed, takes Jack's hand.  He presses
his lips to the kiss-scar.

TYLER

And when you fall asleep, I go places
and do things without you.

103.

EXT. BUILDING (FLASHBACK)

We see that the building is "TRW".  Jack, Bob, Ricky, Angel
Face and another GUY rappel down the die and start SPRAYING
PAINT.  Everyone is more or less paired off.  Jack IS "TYLER"
in his demeanor, mannerisms, speech.  He's next to Angel
Face.

JACK ("TYLER") (TO ANGEL FACE)

You are not your job.  You are not how much money you have
in the bank.

Suddenly, the TWO WINDOWS SHATTER OUTWARD and two of the men
yell out the windows:

I AM NOT MY JOB!

BRUISED MAN #1

BRUISED MAN #2

I AM NOT HOW MUCH MONEY I HAVE IN
THE BANK!

INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

Jack shakes his head in disbelief.

JACK

But you ... you ... you rent the
house.

The house is rented in your name.

TYLER

JACK

You're a projection?  A personality
disorder?  A psychogenic fugue state?

Fuck that.  You're *my* hallucination.

TYLER

JACK

(points to his body)

I was here first.

Who's done more with it?

TYLER

JACK

You're not going to do any more with
it.

What are you going to do?  You
couldn't even figure this out.

TYLER

(MORE)

104.

TYLER (CONT'D)

It's been staring you in the face
for months.  I had to drop my busy
schedule and come here and tell you. 
How are you going to fuck with me? 
You think there's any possibility
that I haven't prepared for?  Do you
think anyone you care about is safe?

Jack quivers with shock, shaking his head, sweating more
profusely.

JACK

No.  This is all ... it's not
possible.  Tyler.  Tyler ... it's a
joke, right?  Right?

Jack FAINTS and falls to the floor, UNCONSCIOUS.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Jack's eyes snap open.  He shoots to his feet.

Tyler ... ?

JACK

He remembers the revelations of the previous night ... he
looks at himself in the mirror.  A sledgehammer of emotions
hits him.  He looks at the clock -- 1:35p.m.

BAM!

INT. HALLWAY

The room door slams against the wall as Jack bursts out of
the room, SPRINTING for the stairs.  Fuck the luggage.

INT. STAIRWELL

Jack takes three steps at a time.

INT. LOBBY

Jack storms for the front door, passing the length of the
front desk.

A DESK CLERK calls out to him.

SIR?!

DESK CLERK

Jack catches sight of the Clerk, who waves a piece of paper.

DESK CLERK (CONT'D)

Please initial the list of phone
calls.

Jack snatches the bill and looks at it.  There's a MASS of
PHONE

NUMBERS.

105.

When were these made?

JACK

DESK CLERK

It says right there, Sir.  Between
two a.m. and five thirty a.m.

Jack grins.  He initials the bill.  The Clerk gives him a
copy.  Jack stuffs the bill into his pocket and disappears
out the door.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - DAY

Jack sits, staring out the window, his face set hard.

EXT. AIRPORT DRIVE - SUNSET

Jack sprints to the curb and leaps onto a taxi.

EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET

The taxi pulls to a halt by the curb.  Jack leaps out and
runs up the front steps.

INT. HOTEL STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Jack sprints up the steps, taking two or three at a time. 
He gets to a landing and turns and runs down to the end of
the

INT. HALLWAY

Where he pounds on Marla's door.  She opens it.  He endures
her baleful gaze for a beat.

MARLA

Your whacked-out, bald feaks threw
me out of the house.  I thought they
were going to kill me.  They almost
broke my arm.

JACK
I'm sorry, I ...

Jack takes both her hands in his.

JACK (CONT'D)

Marla, I'm going to tell you something
and it's going to take a tremendous
act of faith on your part to believe
me.

Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.

MARLA

-- A little *more* faith than that.

JACK

106.

Spill it.

MARLA

INT. MARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jack leads her toward the bed.

JACK

Look, did you notice a big difference
between me when we were having sex
and when ... we weren't?

MARLA

Did I notice?  You're manic-
depressive.  It's like a neon sign
all over you.

No.  It's worse than that.

JACK

Jack sits on the bed, pulling Marla down next to him.  They
and the sheets and covers SLIDE OFF onto the floor.  Jack
keeps his composure and looks into her eyes.

Tyler is my split personality.

JACK (CONT'D)

Then, who are you?

MARLA

Jack takes out his wallet, shows Marla his driver's license.

MARLA (CONT'D)

You gave me a fake name?  What a
jerk.

JACK

*I* didn't give you the fake name --
a *fake person* did.  Listen, those
people all over the house -- you're
in danger.

MARLA

Okay, what do you want?  You want me
to create my own wonder-bitch
personality to match?  So we can be
a foursome?

I WANT YOU TO FUCKING BELIEVE ME!!

JACK

(MORE)

107.

JACK (CONT'D)

YOU WANTED TO TALK?!  WELL, *HERE'S*
OUR FUCKING TALK!!!

Jack's eyes well up with tears.  He turns away from her. 
Marla's face softens.  She strokes Jack's hair, turns his
face to look at her.

MARLA

I'm sorry.  This split personality
thing is ...

A beat of silence.  She squeezes his hand; he squeezes back. 
He looks at her, working up some nerve.

JACK

I've go to know something.  Why did
you respond to Tyler?  Instead of
me.  Sexually.

MARLA

I ... uh ... I don't know what to
say -- *you're* Tyler.

JACK

Okay, however you want to say it --
the abusive side of me -- the asshole
who treated  you like shit and made
you leave in the morning.

MARLA

What do you want?  You want me to
say I'm shit and I deserve to be
treated like shit?  Well, I AM!  And
that's how you GOT ME OFF!! AND

YOU *KNOW IT*!!!

Jack touches her face and she slaps his hand away.  He sighs
and gets to his feet.  He pulls out an airline FLIGHT COUPON
and shows it to her.

JACK

I want you to get out of town for
awhile.  Whether you believe me or
not, you're in *real* danger.  Is
there someplace you can go?

Marla grabs the flight coupon, looks it over.

MARLA

There's plenty of places I'd like to
go.

Jack digs into his pocket and produces a wad of cash.  Marla
roughly seizes the cash, checks out the amount.

108.

JACK

Leave as soon as possible.  Go to a
rural little town, away from any
major city.  Go now.  Okay?  Please. 
Promise?

MARLA

Count on it.  And I'm not paying
this back -- I consider it "asshole
tax".

I agree.  More than you know.

JACK

Marla's expression of rage becomes muddled with confusion
over Jack's almost spiritual tenderness.   Jack starts toward
the door.  A WAVE OF DROWSINESS and FATIGUE hits him.  He
staggers, eyes closing.  He drops onto a chair for a beat
and rests his hand over his face.

He SNAPS AWAKE.  Marla is GONE.  Jack bolts up out of the
seat.

Marla?!

JACK (CONT'D)

INT. HALLWAY

Jack leaps out of the room, looks down the hall in both
directions.

Marla?!

JACK

EXT. PAPER STREET - SUNSET

The taxi screeches to a halt.  Jack leaps out.

Wait here.

JACK

INT. PAPER ST.  HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Jack walks inside to find it completely EMPTY and DESERTED. 
He gawks at the bathtub and canisters that hold vast amounts
of liquid.  He sees bottles labeled "nitric acid".  He TIP-
TOES to the

INT. KITCHEN

And picks up the phone.  He pulls out the hotel bill and
scans the phone numbers.  Through the window, the LAST bit
of SUNLIGHT slowly

SINKS.

Jack punches the first number.

Maintenance.

VOICE (from phone)

A brief silence while Jack absorbs this and adjusts.

109.

JACK

Uh, excuse me.  I'm not sure I have
the right number.  I've been calling
maintenance departments all over the
city, regarding the water supply. 
Which maintenance department is this?

Very good, Sir.

VOICE

Excuse me?

JACK

VOICE

Don't worry about us, Sir.  We're
solid.

Jack hangs up the phone.  He punches the next number.

DIFFERENT VOICE (FROM PHONE)

Maintenance.

Give me your position.

JACK (imitating Tyler)

Huh?  Who's this?

DIFFERENT VOICE (baffled)

JACK

Oh, excuse me.  I'm calling from the
water company.  I've mixed up my
phone numbers.  Which maintenance
department am I talking to?

DIFFERENT VOICE

You almost had me there, Sir. 
Everything's A-okay here.

Jack hangs up the phone.  He punches the next number.

ANOTHER DIFFERENT VOICE (from phone)

Maintenance.

Jack hangs up; punches the next number.

YET ANOTHER DIFFERENT VOICE (from phone)

Maintenance.

Jack hangs up; punches the next number.

110.

EVEN YET ANOTHER VOICE

(from phone)

Maintenance.

A beat while Jack thinks.

There's been a change in the plan.

JACK

You told me you'd say that, Sir.

EVEN YET ANOTHER VOICE

JACK

I don't care what I told you --
there's *really* a change of plan!

EVEN YET ANOTHER VOICE
You told me you'd say *that*, too,
Sir.

JACK

Now, listen to me, you stupid fuck! 
I've got the phone numbers mixed up! 
Tell me where you are!  Now!

EVEN YET ANOTHER VOICE

This is a very good test, Sir.  You
sound like you mean it.

Jack hangs up the phone and KICKS IT.  He flushes red, looks
around at passersby.  He lifts the receiver again and punches
the next number on the hotel bill.

SCRATCHY VOIC

(from phone)

Mason Industrial Electronics.

This is Tyler Durden.

JACK

SCRATCHY VOICE

(harsh whisper)

Are you outta your fucking mind?! 
What the fuck are you doing, calling
me in the daytime?!

I ... have some questions about ...

JACK

SCRATCHY VOICE

Jesus!  I showed your guys how to
use it!  A four-year-old could take
that shit and break through any
security system in the world!  If
you can't then fuck you, moron! 
Now, don't ever call me again!!

Click.  Disconnect.  Jack looks at the receiver, hangs it
up.

111.

EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

Jack gets out of the cab, turns to the CABBIE.

JACK

I gotta have you wait again.  Leave
the meter running.

The Cabbie grins.

There's no charge, Mr. Durden.

CABBIE

Jack gawks at him, backs away.

INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

Jack darts inside and signals to Irvine.  Irvine comes out
from behind the bar and he and Jack move to a corner.  Other
men with BRUISED FACES turn and watch them.

JACK

Look, I need to know where the
nitroglycerin was taken.

Irvine scowls at him a beat, then slowly smiles.

IRVINE
Right, Mr. Durden.

JACK

This isn't a test.  There's been a
mix-up.

You told me you'd say that.

IRVINE

JACK

Where are all the maintenance
departments?!

You told me you'd say that, too.

IRVINE

Jack bristles with rage.  He grabs Irvine's shirt collar.

JACK

Did I tell you I'd call you a
motherfucking asswipe dickhead?!

Yes, you did.

IRVINE

Marla walks into the tavern, makes a beeline for Jack.

112.

WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?!

JACK

MARLA

You told me to meet you here at ten
till.

WHEN?!

JACK

MARLA

Back in my room.  When you dropped
into the chair.

SHIT!

JACK

Irvine and a couple of the bruised-faced guys grin at Marla
and take a few steps towards her.  Jack grabs her and drags
her out the door.

EXT. LOU'S TAVERN

Jack ignores the waiting cabbie and heads for the main road. 
He's stomping along at a brisk pace.  His face hardens into
a mask of psychotic determination.  He pulls Marla with him
onto a run-down side street.

HE DARTS INTO A

INT. PAWN SHOP

He immediately points to something high on a shelf.

Let me see that trumpet.

JACK

The OWNER, a huge, gruff man, pushes a ladder to the spot
starts to climb.  Jack throws himself onto the countertop
near the register, looks around, pulls up a HANDGUN.

Hey!

OWNER

Marla GASPS.  Jack checks the clip -- it's fully-loaded.  He
sprints for the door, dragging Marla.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Jack steps out into traffic.  A LEXUS screeches to a halt. 
Jack goes to the DRIVER'S door and whips it open.

Police emergency.

JACK

Bullshit!

DRIVER

113.

Jack shoves the gun barrel into the Driver's temple.  The
Driver gets out of the car and FLEES.  Jack points the gun
at Marla and motions her to get into the car.  Overwhelmed
by all this, she complies.  Jack leaps behind the wheel and
stomps on the gas.

EXT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION - LATER

Jack drags Marla into the passenger loading area.  A Greyhound
bus is taking on passengers.  Jack sees the DESTINATION --
PHOENIX -- and he impulsively averts his eyes, but too late.

JACK

SHIT!  I can't know where it's going! 
Come on, let's find another one.

Jack drags her to another loading bus.  He keeps his eyes
averted from the DESTINATION sign.

Get on the bus.

JACK (CONT'D)

MARLA (reading the destination)

But I don't want to go to --

JACK (CONT'D)

SHUT UP!  Don't tell me where it's
going!

MARLA

But, the people there talk funny and
their teeth are rotten.

JACK

Shit!  Now, I know it's the rural
South!

Jack jams the gun barrel into Marla's ribs.

Get on that fucking bus right now!

JACK (CONT'D)

Marla starts for the bus.  Jack keeps himself from seeing
the destination sign, but watches Marla get on board.  Then,
the doors close.  Then, the bus pulls away.  Then, the bus
gets to the end of the road and turns a corner.

Jack turns and walks off the passenger platform and out into
the

EXT. STREET NIGHT

He sees a Space Monkey on the corner, watching him.  He looks
down and sees another Monkey in the opposite direction, also
watching him.

JACK (V.O.)

They probably had a map of the city
with little push pins.  I felt like
a migrating goose on "Wild Kingdom. 
Well, fine.  They could watch me do
*this*".

114.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Jack walks past desks of PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES until he
sees a private office.  He glances down at a business card,
then keeps moving forward.

INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Jack steps inside the office to see Detective Stern at the
desk.

JACK

I want you to arrest me.  I'm the
leader of a terrorist organization
that's about to set off bombs all
over the city.

Detective Stern scowls at Jack.

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jack, handcuffed, is led by Detective Stern.  Several other
DETECTIVES follow.  A somber mood prevails.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Stern enters and leads Jack to a table.  All the other
Detectives file inside.  The last one closes the door.  Dim
light from a single bulb overhead creates the tone of a
torture chamber.  Cigarette smoke becomes thick.  Jack sighs
with relief.  It's finally over.  The Detectives all stare
harshly at Jack.

Then, they all BURST into HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.  They slap
and punch Jack's shoulder.

Very good, Mr. Durden.

DETECTIVE STERN

Jack uses all his strength to stifle his utter shock.  He
forces a thin smile.

DETECTIVE STERN (CONT'D)

Operation Domino has everyone a little
skittish right now.  But it's all
going like clockwork.

Jack, ready to explode, keeps the smile plastered on his
face and forces his hand -- like a palsy victim -- to form
the gesture "thumbs up".

115.

The Detectives give him the same gesture in reply.

EXT. BACK OF POLICE STATION - NIGHT

A door opens and Jack is playfully shoved outside.  LAUGHTER
of Detectives rings out.  Jacks starts to walk away from the
police station.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Jack steps out into the street.  In a state of shock, he
lopes forward, dizzy.

JACK

... Operation Domino ... "fall like
dominoes" ... SHIT!  ONE, TWO,

THREE!  YES!

Passersby look at him as if he were a homeless, insane guy.

JACK (CONT'D)

THE BANKS!  What was the first one?! 
Number one, number one ...

*CITIBANK*!

INT. STOLEN LEXUS - MOMENTS LATER

Jack RACES along the streets, swerving and passing cars,
HONKING.

After a beat a MOTORCYCLE COP appears behind Jack and turns
on his SIREN and FLASHING LIGHT.  Jack reflexively slows
down.  The motorcycle moves up beside Jack and the COP SMILES,
waving Jack forward.  The Cop provides an ESCORT.  The Lexus
turns a corner and heads for the

EXT. CITIBANK BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Jack leaps out of the car.  He sprints into the

INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

Two Space Monkeys take over the escort and lead Jack toward
the elevators.

I'll take the stairs.

JACK

Jack darts to the side, throws open the stairwell door.

INT. STAIRWELL

Jack dashes DOWN the steps.

INT. PARKING AREA

Jack races from the stairwell into the parking area, eyes
combing the place.  He darts from one SUPPORT POST to another,
his eyes frantically searching.

He moves around a support post and sees -- Tyler, sitting on
the ground, his back against the post.

116.

Looking for something?

TYLER

Where are the charges at?!

JACK

TYLER

Don't end a sentence with a
preposition.

JACK

WHERE ARE THE CHARGES AT,
*FUCKHEAD*?!!!

TYLER

Listen to "Elephant Balls" ... shit,
slinging a gun.  *Where did I go
right*?

I'll find them.

JACK

Jack moves away, continues looking around support posts.

There's eight floors of parking.

TYLER

I don't give a shit.

JACK

TYLER

You do -- because you don't have
enough time.

Tyler grins, points to his watch.

... Ten minutes.

TYLER (CONT'D)

Jack stalks back toward Tyler, gun raised.

TELL ME WHERE THE CHARGES ARE!

JACK

They're all up and down the building. 
They're not just here.

TYLER

(MORE)

117.

TYLER (CONT'D)

If you tried to stupidly pull a fuse
on a charge, you'd just cause it to
blow up.  The charges are set to go
in a specific order -- so that the
building will implode and collapse. 
If you *did* defuse one of the
charges, you'd fuck up the sequence,
and the building might fall the wrong
way.  Why don't you just find a
television and watch the party?

JACK

I'm awake.  I have control of the
body.  You can't give orders.

TYLER

I don't have any orders left to give. 
It's all set.

Jack boils over, then cracks.  He drops the gun, falls to
his knees and clutches at Tyler.  He touches Tyler's face.

JACK

Tyler.  You're real, aren't you? 
This is all a big joke, isn't it?

You *are* real, you son of a bitch!

Tears well up in Jack's eyes.  He hugs Tyler.  Tyler hugs
him back.

We're both real.

TYLER

Jack squeezes harder, then lifts his head -- he's hugging
ANOTHER JACK.

The real Jack gasps, flinches backwards, landing on the gun. 
He turns, grabs the gun, and turns back around.  Fifty feet
away, Tyler, standing, leans against a pillar.  He winks.

Jack raises the gun, turns it around and aims it at his own
head.

JACK

There's only one way to stop all
this.

Jack shoves the barrel into his mouth.

TYLER

You better not.  If our body is found
dead, the Space Monkeys have orders
to kill Marla.

JACK

Marla is gone -- and you don't know
where.

Tyler's hand suddenly DARTS INTO FRAME, CLOSE-UP and SNATCHES
the gun.

118.

NEW ANGLE

Tyler, laughing, holding the gun,
dashes for the elevator.  Jack sprints
after him.

INT. ELEVATOR

Jack manages to leap inside just as the door closes.  He
lunges at Tyler and fights for the gun.  Tyler, laughing,
manages to retain it.

The elevator climbs rapidly -- blinking numbers indicate
floors whizzing past.

INT. TOP FLOOR LOBBY

The elevator doors open and the struggling pair whirl out
and toward the GLASS WALLS.  Tyler SHOVES Jack's HEAD against
the window, turns it so Jack is looking down.

ANGLE ON STREET

A GREYHOUND BUS sits idling right by the front lobby doors,
having been allowed through the cordon.

INT. TOP FLOOR LOBBY - RESUMING

As Tyler and Jack continue to stare downward.

That's ... not the bus.

JACK

You know it is.

TYLER

Tyler swings Jack away from the window and shoves him
backwards.

TYLER (CONT'D)

Now, can you grasp that there's
nothing you can do?

Jack raises the gun, aiming at Tyler.  Tyler laughs, but
flinches --

just as Jack FIRES.  The bullet chews out a CHUNK of the
wall.

JACK

I'm not going to kill myself.  I'm
going to kill *you*.

119.

Tyler laughs, but he starts rapidly moving down the hallway.

TYLER

You can't kill me!  How can you kill
me?!

Jack FIRES again, missing Tyler.  Tyler breaks into a sprint. 
Jack does the same.

INT. HALLWAY

Jack turns a corner, sees Tyler at the end of the section of
hallway, heading for an intersection.  Jack aims the gun at
Tyler.  RAPID CUT

TO:

SECURITY CAMERA POV - HALLWAY

Jack aims the gun at himself.  RAPID CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY

Jack FIRES.  As Tyler flinches down -- RAPID CUT TO:

SECURITY CAMERA POV - HALLWAY

*Jack* flinches down, having shot at himself.  RAPID CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY

Jack resumes sprinting until he turns a corner to

INT. NEW SECTION OF HALLWAY

Jack sees Tyler turn, freeze, then leap sideways toward a
room.  Jack

FIRES.  The bullet GRAZES Tyler's leg.  RAPID CUT TO:

SECURITY CAMERA POV - HALLWAY

Jack, with the gun still aimed at his own leg, falls
backwards,

bleeding from  the graze wound his just gave himself.  RAPID
CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY

Jack pulls himself to his feet, and, his face now looking
completely insane, runs with his limp, holding the gun up,
ready to fire.  He turns a corner to --

120.

INT. TOP FLOOR LOBBY

And suddenly, Tyler LEAPS onto Jack.  RAPID CUT TO:

SECURITY CAMERA POV - LOBBY

Jack crumples to the floor and wrestles with himself.  He
punches himself, he tries to trap pin his own arms, he kicks
himself. 

RAPID CUT TO:

INT. TOP FLOOR LOBBY

Tyler leaps to his feet and dashes away.  Jack pulls himself
up and follows into a --

INT. LARGE SOCIAL ROOM

With floor-to-ceiling windows showing a view of the city. 
There are a HUNDRED DUFFEL BAGS lining the floor, along the
walls.

Tyler leaps onto Jack seizes the gun.  Jack holds onto Tyler. 
Tyler shoves the gun barrel into Jack's mouth.

TYLER

Okay -- let's kill you -- let's kill
*both* of us.  Be a martyr for the
cause.

Tyler pushes Jack against a glass wall.  Jack, exhausted, is
losing his spirit.

JACK (V.O.)

I think this is about where we came
in.

Two minutes.

TYLER

Jack collapses to the floor.  Tyler moves down with him,
keeping the gun in Jack's mouth.  He sits on Jack.

JACK

Either way -- the building blows us
up or you pull the trigger -- it'll
finally be over.

TYLER

This building isn't going to blow
up.  It's the observation room.  Pay-
per-view.  So, what are you going to
do?  You don't even have the guts to
make a decision.

121.

Jack looks into his eyes for a moment, then reaches up and
PULLS THE TRIGGER.  *GO TO SLOW MOTION* AS -- KABLAM! his
cheeks INFLATE with gas from the gun.  His eyes bulge, BLOOD
flies out backwards from his head.

SMOKE wafts out of his mouth.

RESUME NORMAL SPEED as Tyler gapes at Jack, then reaches
behind his head and feels -- there's a HOLE BLOWN OUT THE
BACK.  Tyler's eyes glaze over and he falls backwards,
plopping on the floor, DEAD, with a grin on his face.

A throng of Space Monkeys -- two of whom drag Marla -- RUSHES
into the room.  They see Jack, ALONE, holding a gun, bleeding
profusely from the side of his face, where he's SHOT A HOLE
through HIS CHEEK.  He stares at the empty floor in front of
him with his weird, little smile.

ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?!!

TALL SPACE MONKEY

The two Space Monkeys who hold Marla press forward through
the crowd.

One of them puts a GUN to her head.  He COCKS it.

ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?!!

TALL SPACE MONKEY (CONT'D)

Jack takes in the sight of Marla and the gun at her head. 
He cracks a Tyler-esque grin.

Everything's fine.  Give me the girl.

JACK

The Monkeys release Marla.  She moves next to Jack, now
becoming more shocked by his bloody state.  Jack grabs her
arm.  She digs through her purse and pulls out a wad of tissue
paper.  She puts them into his mouth to plug the hole.

What the fuck is going on?!

MARLA

Jack cracks his weird, little smile; his eyes are wide and
half-insane-looking.  He winks at Marla and squeezes her
hand.

Tyler's dead.

JACK

The Space Monkeys all grab their duffel bags and file out of
the room, saluting Jack as they go.

Now, Jack and Marla are completely alone.  He struggles to
get to his feet.  She helps him.  They look out the window.

MASSIVE EXPLOSION -- a building a quarter of a mile away. 
It's destruction is completely visible from here.  The glass
walls RATTLE LOUDLY from the shock wave.  They both stare
out the window.

122.

JACK

Listen, you met me at a really weird
time in my life ...

Marla looks at Jack, then looks back out the window.  He
reaches for her hand.  She takes his hand.

They are SILHOUETTED against BRIGHT FLASHES as ANOTHER
BUILDING EXPLODES and COLLAPSES.  ANOTHER BUILDING EXPLODES. 
And ANOTHER BUILDING.  And ANOTHER BUILDING.

The FILM SLOWS DOWN, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME --
SHOWING the SPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES.  It's CAUGHT in the
mechanism of the projector's GATE.  EACH FRAME is the
EXPLODING BUILDINGS -- then, *ONE FRAME is a PENIS*.  Then,
EXPLODING BUILDINGS again.  SPEED UP the frames, LOSE the
sprocket holes, RESUME NORMAL SPEED.

*THE END*

FADE OUT
