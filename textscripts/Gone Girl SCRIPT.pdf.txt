AMY (V.0.)

I met a boy.

She spots her FRIEND deep-flirting a guy, and stops midway,
stuck with TWO BEERS. She makes her way toward a table with
picked—over food and scans the room for anyone she knows. She
spots NICK DUNNE—he spots her.

AMY (V.0.)

A great, gorgeous, sweet, cool-ass
guy.

Nick weaves his way over. She’s setting down her beer.

NICK

It’s dangerous to set down a monk—
brewed Belgian wheat beer when the
party is down to three Beast Lites
and a bottle of Pucker.

Might attract some desperate
characters.

He gestures toward a group of Williamsburg musician-types:

Things could get ugly. The Amish

They already relieved me of my

rimmed, haughty DOUCHEBAG.

I can’t picture you sitting still
while he bloviates about his post-

Nick points to a sideburned guy in a NOVELTY TEE.

Ironic hipster so self—aware he
makes everything a joke?

AMY

I prefer men who are funny, not
‘~funny.”

Nick points to a wavy-haired granola-yoga type.

NICK

Please tell me it’s not Deeply
Sensitive Emo-Dude

strong women.”

NICK

Code for ‘~I hate strong women.”

A beat as they scan the room,

AMY’s gorgeous MISSING poster is revealed. An AMAZING AMY
book jacket is revealed. Everyone is extremely attentive.

they put down their sandwiches.

NICK

Thank you for coming. My wife, Amy
Elliott Dunne, went missing from
our home on July 5 between 9 am and
11:30 am under very concerning
circumstances. We ask for anyone
who may have knowledge of what has
happened to her to come forward.

And.. .he’s done? Rand steps in.

Amy is a decorated scholar. She
forged a successful career in
journalism. She returned here to
her husband’s hometown, and she
made a life in her adopted home.
Now Amy needs your help. We are

Nick and the Elliotts pause for a few photos. The Elliotts
look devastated; NICK looks annoyed. A PHOTOG asks Nick to
pose next to Amy’s photo: a demented PROM SHOT. SNAP!

NICK looks more annoyed. He glances at GO; she prods him to
SMILE. NICK flashes a sudden, smarmy SMILE, overly charming

BONEY, RAND AND MARYBETH and NICK are at a conference table.
Boney is taking notes. The Elliotts have their two suitcases

albums, news clippings, Amazing Amy books.

MARYBETH

We have suspects you’ll want to

The BLOOD pulses out as DESI grabs at his neck, but ANY won’t
let him go. The two roll over, Amy on top, holding him down.
DESI makes one more try for freedom and the two roll back

No, my wife must always be faced.

The crowd hushes as AMY shows up on TV: Reporters have
surrounded her as she tries to slip inside a grocery store.

Nick and I have had our bad
