LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	6

I’m	pretty	much	fucked.

That’s	my	considered	opinion.

Fucked.

Six	days	in	to	what	should	be	a	greatest	two	months	of	my	life,	and	it’s	turned	in
to	a	nightmare.

I	don’t	even	know	who’l	read	this.	I	guess	someone	wil	find	it	eventualy.	Maybe
a	hundred	years	from	now.

For	the	record…	I	didn’t	die	on	Sol	6.	Certainly	the	rest	of	the	crew	thought	I
did,	and	I	can’t	blame	them.	Maybe	there’l	be	a	day	of

national	mourning	for	me,	and	my	Wikipedia	page	wil	say	“Mark	Watney	is	the
only	human	being	to	have	died	on	Mars.”

And	it’l	be	right,	probably.	Cause	I’l	surely	die	here.	Just	not	on	Sol	6	when
everyone	thinks	I	did.

Let’s	see…	where	do	I	begin?

The	Ares	program.	Mankind	reaching	out	to	Mars	to	send	people	to	another
planet	for	the	very	first	time	and	expand	the	horizons	of

humanity	blah,	blah,	blah.	The	Ares	1	crew	did	their	thing	and	came	back
heroes.	They	got	the	parades	and	fame	and	love	of	the	world.

Ares	2	did	the	same	thing,	in	a	different	location	on	Mars.	They	got	a	firm
handshake	and	a	hot	cup	of	coffee	when	they	got	home.

Ares	3.	Wel.	That	was	my	mission.	Wel,	not	mine	per	se.	Commander	Lewis	was
in	charge.	I	was	just	one	of	her	crew.	Actualy,	I

was	the	very	lowest	ranked	member	of	the	crew.	I	would	only	be	“in	command”
of	the	mission	if	I	were	the	only	remaining	person.

What	do	you	know?	I’m	in	command.

I	wonder	if	this	log	wil	be	recovered	before	the	rest	of	the	crew	die	of	old	age?	I
presume	they	got	back	to	Earth	al	right.	Wel,	guys,	if	you’re	reading	this:	It
wasn’t	your	fault.	You	did	what	you	had	to	do.	In	your	position	I	would	have
done	the	same	thing.	I	don’t	blame	you,	and	I’m	glad	you	survived.

I	guess	I	should	explain	how	Mars	missions	work,	for	any	layman	who	may	be
reading	this.	We	got	to	earth	orbit	the	normal	way,

through	an	ordinary	ship	to	Hermes.	Al	the	Ares	missions	use	Hermes	to	get	to
and	from	Mars.	It’s	realy	big	and	cost	a	lot	so	NASA	only

built	one.

Once	we	got	to	Hermes,	four	additional	unmanned	missions	brought	us	fuel	and
supplies	while	we	prepared	for	our	trip.	Once

everything	was	a	go,	we	set	out	for	Mars.	But	not	very	fast.	Gone	are	the	days	of
heavy	chemical	fuel	burns	and	trans-Mars	injection

orbits.

Hermes	is	powered	by	ion	engines.	They	throw	Argon	out	the	back	of	the	ship
realy	fast	to	get	a	tiny	amount	of	acceleration.	The	thing

is,	it	doesn't	take	much	reactant	mass,	so	a	little	Argon	(and	a	nuclear	reactor	to
power	things)	let	us	accelerate	constantly	the	whole	way	there.	You'd	be	amazed
at	how	fast	you	can	get	going	with	a	tiny	acceleration	over	a	long	time.

I	could	regale	you	with	tales	of	how	we	had	great	fun	on	the	trip,	but	I	won’t.	We
did	have	fun,	but	I	don’t	feel	like	reliving	it	right	now.

Suffice	it	to	say	we	got	to	Mars	124	days	later	without	strangling	each	other.

From	there,	we	took	the	MDV	(Mars	Descent	Vehicle)	to	the	surface.	The	MDV
is	basicaly	a	big	can	with	some	light	thrusters	and

parachutes	attached.	Its	sole	purpose	is	to	get	six	humans	from	Mars	orbit	to	the
surface	without	kiling	any	of	them.

And	now	we	come	to	the	real	trick	of	Mars	exploration:	Having	al	our	shit	there
in	advance.

A	total	of	14	unmanned	missions	deposited	everything	we	would	need	for
surface	operations.	They	tried	their	best	to	land	al	the	supply

vessels	in	the	same	general	area,	and	did	a	reasonably	good	job.	Supplies	aren’t
nearly	so	fragile	as	humans	and	can	hit	the	ground	realy	hard.	But	they	tended	to
bounce	around	a	lot.

Naturaly,	they	didn’t	send	us	to	Mars	until	they’d	confirmed	al	the	supplies	had
made	it	to	the	surface	and	their	containers	weren’t

breached.	Start	to	finish,	including	supply	missions,	a	Mars	mission	takes	about
3	years.	In	fact,	there	were	Ares	3	supplies	en	route	to	Mars	while	the	Ares	2
crew	were	on	their	way	home.

The	most	important	piece	of	the	advance	supplies,	of	course,	was	the	MAV.	The
“Mars	Ascent	Vehicle.”	That	was	how	we	would	get

back	to	Hermes	after	surface	operations	were	complete.	The	MAV	was	soft-
landed	(as	opposed	to	the	baloon	bounce-fest	the	other

supplies	had).	Of	course,	it	was	in	constant	communication	with	Houston,	and	if
there	were	any	problems	with	it,	we	would	pass	by	Mars

and	go	back	to	Earth	without	ever	landing.

The	MAV	is	pretty	cool.	Turns	out,	through	a	neat	set	of	chemical	reactions	with
the	Martian	atmosphere,	for	every	kilogram	of

hydrogen	you	bring	to	Mars,	you	can	make	13	kilograms	of	fuel.	It’s	a	slow
process,	though.	It	takes	24	months	to	fil	the	tank.	That’s	why	they	sent	it	long
before	we	got	here.

You	can	imagine	how	disappointed	I	was	when	I	discovered	the	MAV	was	gone.

It	was	a	ridiculous	sequence	of	events	that	led	to	me	almost	dying.	Then	an	even
more	ridiculous	sequence	that	led	to	me	surviving.

The	mission	is	designed	to	handle	sandstorm	gusts	up	to	150	km/hr.	So	Houston
got	understandably	nervous	when	we	got	whacked

with	175	km/hr	winds.	We	al	got	in	our	suits	and	huddled	in	the	middle	of	the
Hab,	just	in	case	it	lost	pressure.	But	the	Hab	wasn’t	the	problem.

The	MAV	is	a	spaceship.	It	has	a	lot	of	delicate	parts.	It	can	put	up	with	storms
to	a	certain	extent	but	it	can’t	just	get	sandblasted

forever.	After	an	hour	and	a	half	of	sustained	wind,	NASA	gave	the	order	to
abort.	Nobody	wanted	to	stop	a	month-long	mission	after

only	six	days	but	if	the	MAV	took	any	more	punishment	we’d	al	get	stranded
down	here.

We	had	to	go	out	in	the	storm	to	get	from	the	Hab	to	the	MAV.	That	was	going	to
be	risky,	but	what	choice	did	we	have?

Everyone	made	it	but	me.

Our	main	communications	dish,	which	relayed	signals	from	the	Hab	to	Hermes,
acted	like	a	parachute,	getting	torn	from	its	foundation

and	carried	with	the	torrent.	Along	the	way,	it	crashed	through	the	reception
antenna	array.	Then	one	of	those	long	thin	antennae	slammed	in	to	me	end	first.
It	tore	through	my	suit	like	a	bulet	through	butter	and	I	felt	the	worst	pain	of	my
life	as	it	ripped	open	my	side.	I	vaguely	remember	suddenly	having	the	wind
knocked	out	of	me	(puled	out	of	me,	realy)	and	my	ears	popping	painfuly	as	the
pressure	of	my	suit

escaped.

The	last	thing	I	remember	was	seeing	Johanssen	hopelessly	reaching	out	toward
me.

I	awoke	to	the	oxygen	alarm	in	my	suit.	A	steady,	obnoxious	beeping	that
eventualy	roused	me	from	a	deep	and	profound	desire	to

just	fucking	die.

The	storm	had	abated;	I	was	face	down,	almost	totaly	buried	in	sand.	As	I
groggily	came	to,	I	wondered	why	I	wasn’t	more	dead.

The	antenna	had	enough	force	to	punch	through	the	suit	and	my	side,	but	then	it
got	stopped	by	my	pelvis.	So	there	was	only	one	hole

in	the	suit	(and	a	hole	in	me,	of	course).

I	had	been	knocked	back	quite	a	ways	and	roled	down	a	steep	hil.	Somehow	I
landed	face	down,	which	forced	the	antenna	to	a

strongly	oblique	angle	that	put	a	lot	of	torque	on	the	hole	in	the	suit.	It	made	a
weak	seal.

Then,	the	copious	blood	from	my	wound	trickled	down	toward	the	hole.	As	the
blood	reached	the	site	of	the	breach,	the	water	in	it

quickly	evaporated	from	the	airflow	and	low	pressure,	leaving	only	a	gunky
residue	behind.	More	blood	came	in	behind	it	and	was	also

reduced	to	gunk.	Eventualy,	the	blood	sealed	the	gaps	around	the	hole	and
reduced	the	leak	to	something	the	suit	could	counteract.

The	suit	did	its	job	admirably.	Seeing	the	drop	in	pressure,	it	constantly	flooded
itself	with	air	from	my	nitrogen	tank	to	equalize.	Once	the	leak	became
manageable,	it	only	had	to	trickle	new	air	in	slowly	the	relieve	the	air	lost.

After	a	while,	the	CO2	(carbon	dioxide)	absorbers	in	the	suit	were	expended.
That’s	realy	the	limiting	factor	to	life	support.	Not	the

amount	of	oxygen	you	bring	with	you,	but	the	amount	of	CO2	you	can	remove.
In	the	Hab,	we	had	the	Oxygenator,	a	large	piece	of

equipment	that	could	break	CO2	apart	and	give	the	oxygen	back.	But	the
spacesuits	had	to	be	portable,	so	they	used	a	simple	chemical

absorption	process	with	expendable	filters.	I’d	been	asleep	long	enough	that	my
filters	were	useless.

The	suit	saw	this	problem	and	moved	in	to	an	emergency	mode	the	engineers	cal
“bloodletting”.	Having	no	way	to	separate	out	the

CO2,	the	suit	deliberately	vented	air	to	the	Martian	atmosphere,	then	back-filed
with	nitrogen.	Between	the	breach	and	the	bloodletting,	it	quickly	ran	out	of
nitrogen.	Al	it	had	left	was	my	oxygen	tank.

So	it	did	the	only	thing	it	could	to	keep	me	alive.	It	started	back-filing	with	pure
oxygen.	I	now	risked	dying	from	oxygen	toxicity,	as	the	excessively	high
amount	of	oxygen	threatened	to	burn	up	my	nervous	system,	lungs,	and	eyes.	An
ironic	death	for	someone	with	a	leaky	space	suit:	too	much	oxygen.

Every	step	of	the	way	would	have	had	beeping	alarms,	alerts,	and	warnings.	But
it	was	the	high-oxygen	warning	that	woke	me.

The	sheer	volume	of	training	for	a	space	mission	is	astounding.	I	spent	a	week
back	on	Earth	practicing	emergency	space	suit	drils.	I

knew	what	to	do.

Carefuly	reaching	to	the	side	of	my	helmet,	I	got	the	breach	kit.	It’s	nothing
more	than	a	funnel	with	a	valve	at	the	smal	end,	and	an

unbelievably	sticky	resin	on	the	wide	end.	The	idea	is	you	have	the	valve	open
and	stick	the	wide	end	over	a	hole.	The	air	can	escape

through	the	valve,	so	it	doesn’t	interfere	with	the	resin	making	a	good	seal.	Then
you	close	the	valve	and	you’ve	sealed	the	breach.

The	tricky	part	was	getting	the	antenna	out	of	the	way.	I	puled	it	out	as	fast	as	I
could,	wincing	as	the	sudden	pressure	drop	dizzied	me	and	made	the	wound	in
my	side	scream	in	agony.

I	got	the	breach	kit	over	the	hole	and	sealed	it.	It	held.	The	suit	back-filed	the
missing	air	with	yet	more	oxygen.	Checking	my	arm

readouts,	I	saw	the	suit	was	now	at	85%	oxygen.	For	reference,	Earth’s
atmosphere	is	about	21%.	I’d	be	ok,	so	long	as	I	didn’t	spend	too	much	time	like
that.

I	stumbled	up	the	hil	back	toward	the	Hab.	As	I	crested	the	rise,	I	saw	something
that	made	me	very	happy	and	something	that	made

me	very	sad:	The	Hab	was	in-tact	(yay!)	and	the	MAV	was	gone	(boo!).

Right	that	moment	I	knew	I	was	screwed.	But	I	didn’t	want	to	just	die	out	on	the
surface.	I	limped	back	to	the	Hab	and	fumbled	my

way	in	to	an	airlock.	As	soon	as	it	equalized,	I	threw	off	my	helmet.

Entering	the	Hab,	I	doffed	the	suit	and	got	my	first	good	look	at	the	injury.	It
would	need	stitches.	Fortunately,	al	of	us	had	been

trained	in	basic	medical	procedures,	and	the	Hab	had	excelent	medical	supplies.
A	quick	shot	of	local	anesthetic,	irrigate	the	wound,	9

stitches	and	I	was	done.	I’d	be	taking	antibiotics	for	a	couple	of	weeks,	but	other
than	that	I’d	be	fine.

I	knew	it	was	hopeless,	but	I	tried	firing	up	the	communication	array.	No	signal,
of	course.	The	primary	satelite	dish	had	broken	off,

remember?	And	it	took	the	reception	antennae	with	it.	The	Hab	had	secondary
and	tertiary	communication	systems,	but	they	were	both	just

for	talking	to	the	MAV,	which	would	use	its	much	more	powerful	systems	to
relay	to	Hermes.	Thing	is,	that	only	works	if	the	MAV	is	stil

around.

I	had	no	way	to	talk	to	Hermes.	In	time,	I	could	locate	the	dish	out	on	the
surface,	but	it	would	take	weeks	for	me	to	rig	up	any	repairs,	and	that	would	be
too	late.	In	an	abort,	Hermes	would	leave	orbit	within	24	hours.	The	orbital
dynamics	made	the	trip	safer	and	shorter	the	earlier	you	left,	so	why	wait	for	no
reason	just	to	make	the	trip	take	longer?

Checking	out	my	suit,	I	saw	the	antenna	had	plowed	through	my	bio-monitor
computer.	When	on	an	EVA,	al	the	crew’s	suits	are

networked	so	we	can	see	each	others	status.	The	rest	of	the	crew	would	have

seen	the	pressure	in	my	suit	drop	to	nearly	0,	folowed

immediately	by	my	bio-signs	going	flat.	Add	to	that	I	was	sent	tumbling	down	a
hil	with	a	spear	through	me	in	the	middle	of	a	sandstorm…

yeah.	They	thought	I	was	dead.	How	could	they	not?

They	may	have	even	had	a	brief	discussion	about	recovering	my	body,	but
regulations	were	clear.	In	the	event	a	crewman	died	on

Mars,	he	stayed	on	Mars.	Leaving	his	body	behind	reduced	weight	for	the	MAV
on	the	trip	back.	That	meant	more	disposable	fuel	and	a

larger	margin	of	error	for	the	return	thrust.	No	point	in	giving	that	up	for
sentimentality.

So	that’s	the	situation.	I’m	stranded	on	Mars.	I	have	no	way	to	communicate
with	Hermes	or	Earth.	Everyone	thinks	I’m	dead.	I’m	in	a

Hab	designed	to	last	31	days.

If	the	Oxygenator	breaks	down,	I’l	suffocate.	If	the	Water	Reclaimer	breaks
down,	I’l	die	of	thirst.	If	the	Hab	breaches,	I’l	just	kind

of	explode.	If	none	of	those	things	happen,	I’l	eventualy	run	out	of	food	and
starve	to	death.

So	yeah.	I’m	fucked.

Chapter	2

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	7

Ok,	I’ve	had	a	good	night’s	sleep,	and	things	don’t	seem	as	hopeless	as	they	did
yesterday.

Today	I	took	stock	of	supplies,	and	did	a	quick	EVA	to	check	up	on	the	external
equipment.	Here’s	my	situation:

The	surface	mission	was	supposed	to	be	31	days.	For	redundancy,	the	supply
probes	had	enough	food	to	last	the	whole	crew	56	days.

That	way	if	one	or	two	probes	had	problems,	we'd	stil	have	enough	food	to
complete	the	mission.

We	were	six	days	in	when	al	hel	broke	loose,	so	that	leaves	enough	food	to	feed
six	people	for	50	days.	I’m	just	one	guy,	so	it’l	last

me	300	days.	And	that’s	if	I	don’t	ration	it.	So	I’ve	got	a	fair	bit	of	time.

The	Hab	stood	up	to	the	storm	without	any	problems.	Outside,	things	aren’t	so
rosy.	I	can’t	find	the	satelite	dish;	it	probably	got	blown	kilometers	away.

The	MAV	is	gone,	of	course.	My	crewmates	took	it	up	to	Hermes.	Though	the
bottom	half	(the	landing	stage)	is	stil	there.	No	reason

to	take	that	back	up	when	weight	is	the	enemy.	It	includes	the	landing	gear,	the
fuel	plant,	and	anything	else	NASA	figured	it	wouldn’t	need	for	the	trip	back	up
to	orbit.

The	MDV	is	on	its	side	and	there’s	a	breach	in	the	hul.	Looks	like	the	storm
ripped	the	cowling	off	the	reserve	chute	(which	we	didn’t

have	to	use	on	landing).	Once	the	chute	was	exposed	it	dragged	the	MDV	al	over
the	place,	smashing	it	against	every	rock	in	the	area.

Not	that	the	MDV	would	be	much	use	to	me.	Its	thrusters	can’t	even	lift	its	own

weight.	But	it	might	have	been	valuable	for	parts.	Might	stil	be.

Both	rovers	are	half-buried	in	sand,	but	they’re	in	good	shape	otherwise.	Their
pressure	seals	are	in-tact.	Makes	sense.	Operating

procedure	if	a	storm	hits	is	to	stop	motion	and	wait	for	the	storm	to	pass.	They’re
made	to	stand	up	to	punishment.	I’l	be	able	to	dig	them	out	with	a	day	or	so	of
work.

I’ve	lost	communication	with	the	weather	stations,	placed	a	kilometer	away	from
the	Hab	in	4	directions.	They	might	be	in	perfect

working	order	for	al	I	know.	The	Hab’s	communications	are	so	weak	right	now	it
probably	can’t	even	reach	a	kilometer.

The	solar	cel	array	was	covered	it	in	sand,	rendering	it	useless	(hint:	solar	cels
need	sunlight	to	make	electricity).	But	once	I	swept

them	off,	they	returned	to	ful	efficiency.	Whatever	I	end	up	doing,	I’l	have
plenty	of	power	for	it.	200	square	meters	of	solar	cels,	with	hydrogen	fuel	cels	to
store	plenty	of	reserve.	Al	I	need	to	do	is	sweep	them	off	every	few	days.

Things	indoors	are	great,	thanks	to	the	Hab’s	sturdy	design.

I	ran	a	ful	diagnostic	on	the	Oxygenator.	Twice.	It’s	perfect.	If	anything	goes
wrong	with	it,	there	is	a	short-term	spare	I	can	use.	But	it’s	solely	for	emergency
use	while	repairing	the	main	one.	The	spare	doesn’t	actualy	pul	CO2	apart	and
recapture	the	oxygen.	It	just

absorbs	the	CO2	the	same	way	the	spacesuits	do.	It’s	intended	to	last	5	days
before	it	saturates	the	filters,	which	means	30	days	for	me	(just	one	person
breathing,	instead	of	six).	So	there’s	some	insurance	there.

The	Water	Reclaimer	is	working	fine,	too.	The	bad	news	is	there’s	no	backup.	If
it	stops	working,	I’l	be	drinking	reserve	water	while	I

rig	up	a	primitive	distilery	to	boil	piss.	Also,	I’l	lose	half	a	liter	of	water	per	day
to	breathing	until	the	humidity	in	the	Hab	reaches	its	maximum	and	water	starts
condensing	on	every	surface.	Then	I’l	be	licking	the	wals.	Yay.	Anyway,	for
now,	no	problems	with	the	Water

Reclaimer.

So	yeah.	Food,	water,	shelter	al	taken	care	of.	I’m	going	to	start	rationing	food
right	now.	Meals	are	pretty	minimal	already,	but	I	think	I	can	eat	a	3/4	portion
per	meal	and	stil	be	al	right.	That	should	turn	my	300	days	of	food	in	to	400.
Foraging	around	the	medical	area,	I	found	the	main	bottle	of	vitamins.	There’s
enough	multivitamins	there	to	last	years.	So	I	won’t	have	any	nutritional
problems	(though	I’l	stil	starve	to	death	when	I’m	out	of	food,	no	matter	how
many	vitamins	I	take).

The	medical	area	has	morphine	for	emergencies.	And	there’s	enough	there	for	a
lethal	dose.	I’m	not	going	to	slowly	starve	to	death,	I’l

tel	you	that.	If	I	get	to	that	point,	I’l	take	an	easier	way	out.

Everyone	on	the	mission	had	two	specialties.	I’m	a	botanist	and	mechanical
engineer.	Basicaly,	I	was	the	mission’s	fix-it	man	who

played	with	plants.	The	mechanical	engineering	might	save	my	life	if	something
breaks.

I’ve	been	thinking	about	how	to	survive	this.	It’s	not	completely	hopeless.
There’l	be	humans	back	on	Mars	in	about	four	years	when

Ares	4	arrives	(assuming	they	didn’t	cancel	the	program	in	the	wake	of	my
“death”).

Ares	4	wil	be	landing	at	the	Schiapareli	Crater,	which	is	about	3,200km	away
from	my	location	here	in	the	Acidalia	Planitia.	No	way

for	me	to	get	there	on	my	own.	But	if	I	could	communicate,	I	might	be	able	to
get	a	rescue.	Not	sure	how	they’d	manage	that	with	the

resources	on	hand,	but	NASA	has	a	lot	of	smart	people.

So	that’s	my	mission	now.	Find	a	way	to	communicate	with	Earth.	If	I	can’t
manage	that,	find	a	way	to	communicate	with	Hermes

when	it	returns	in	4	years	with	the	Ares	4	crew.

Of	course,	I	don’t	have	any	plan	for	surviving	4	years	on	1	year	of	food.	But	one
thing	at	a	time	here.	For	now,	I’m	wel	fed	and	have	a

purpose:	“Fix	the	damn	radio”.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	10

Wel,	I’ve	done	three	EVAs	and	haven’t	found	any	hint	of	the	communication
dish.

I	dug	out	one	of	the	rovers	and	had	a	good	drive	around,	but	after	days	of
wandering	I	think	it’s	time	to	give	up.	The	storm	probably

blew	the	dish	far	away	and	then	erased	any	drag-marks	or	scuffs	that	might	have
led	to	a	trail.	Probably	buried	it,	too.

I	spent	most	of	today	out	at	what’s	left	of	the	communication	array.	It’s	realy	a
sorry	sight.	I	may	as	wel	yel	toward	Earth	for	al	the

good	that	damned	thing	wil	do	me.

I	could	throw	together	a	rudimentary	dish	out	of	metal	I	find	around	the	base,	but
this	isn’t	some	walkie-talkie	I’m	working	with	here.

Communicating	from	Mars	to	Earth	is	a	pretty	big	deal,	and	requires	extremely
specialized	equipment.	I	won’t	be	able	to	whip	something

up	with	tinfoil	and	gum.

I	need	to	ration	my	EVAs	as	wel	as	food.	The	CO2	filters	are	not	cleanable.
Once	they’re	saturated,	they’re	done.	The	mission

accounted	for	a	4-hour	EVA	per	crewmember	per	day.	Fortunately,	CO2	filters
are	light	and	smal	so	NASA	had	the	luxury	of	sending

more	than	we	needed.	Al	told,	I	have	about	1500	hours	worth	of	CO2	filters.
After	that,	any	EVAs	I	do	wil	have	to	be	managed	with

bloodletting	the	air.

1500	hours	may	sound	like	a	lot,	but	I’m	faced	with	spending	at	least	4	years

here	if	I’m	going	to	have	any	hope	of	rescue,	with	a

minimum	of	several	hours	per	week	dedicated	to	sweeping	off	the	solar	array.
Anyway.	No	needless	EVAs.

In	other	news,	I’m	starting	to	come	up	with	an	idea	for	food.	My	botany
background	may	come	in	useful	after	al.

Why	bring	a	botanist	to	Mars?	After	al,	it’s	famous	for	not	having	anything
growing	here.	Wel,	the	idea	was	to	figure	out	how	wel

things	grow	in	Martian	gravity,	and	see	what,	if	anything,	we	can	do	with
Martian	soil.	The	short	answer	is:	quite	a	lot…	almost.	Martian	soil	has	the	basic
building	blocks	needed	for	plant	growth,	but	there’s	a	lot	of	stuff	going	on	in
Earth	soil	that	Mars	soil	doesn’t	have,	even	when	it’s	placed	in	an	Earth-
atmosphere	and	given	plenty	of	water.	Bacterial	activity,	certain	nutrients
provided	by	animal	life,	etc.	None	of	that	is	happening	on	Mars.	One	of	my	tasks
for	the	mission	was	to	see	how	plants	grow	here,	in	various	combinations	of
Earth	or	Mars	soil	and	atmosphere.

That’s	why	I	have	a	smal	amount	of	Earth	soil	and	a	bunch	of	plant	seeds	with
me.

I	can’t	get	too	excited,	however.	It’s	about	the	amount	of	soil	you’d	put	in	a
window	planter-box,	and	the	only	seeds	I	have	are	a	few

species	of	grass	and	ferns.	They’re	the	most	rugged	and	easily	grown	plants	on
earth,	so	NASA	picked	them	as	the	test	subjects.

So	I	have	two	problems:	not	enough	dirt,	and	nothing	edible	to	plant	in	it.

But	I’m	a	botanist,	damn	it.	I	should	be	able	to	find	a	way	to	make	this	happen.
If	I	don’t,	I’l	be	a	realy	hungry	botanist	in	about	a

year.

I	wonder	how	the	Cubs	are	doing.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	14

I	got	my	undergrad	degree	at	the	University	of	Chicago.	Half	the	people	who
studied	botany	were	hippies	who	thought	they	could

return	to	some	natural	world	system.	Somehow	feeding	7	bilion	people	through
pure	gathering.	They	spent	most	of	their	time	working	out

better	ways	to	grow	pot.	I	didn’t	like	them.	I’ve	always	been	in	it	for	the	science,
not	for	any	New	World	Order	bulshit.

When	they	made	compost	heaps	and	tried	to	conserve	every	little	ounce	of	living
matter,	I	laughed	at	them.	“Look	at	the	sily	hippies!”	I	would	scoff.	“Look	at
their	pathetic	attempts	to	simulate	a	complex	global	ecosystem	in	their	back
yard.”

Of	course	now	I’m	doing	exactly	that.	I’m	saving	every	scrap	of	biomatter	I	can
find.	Every	time	I	finish	a	meal,	the	leftovers	go	to	the	compost	bucket.	As	for
other	biological	material…

The	Hab	has	sophisticated	toilets.	Shit	is	usualy	vaccum-dried,	then	accumulated
in	sealed	bags	to	be	discarded	on	the	surface.

Not	any	more!

In	fact,	I	even	did	an	EVA	to	recover	the	previous	bags	of	shit	from	before	the
crew	left.	Being	completely	desiccated,	this	particular

shit	didn’t	have	bacteria	in	it	anymore,	but	it	stil	had	complex	proteins	and
would	serve	as	useful	manure.	Adding	it	to	water	and	active	bacteria	would
quickly	get	it	inundated,	replacing	any	population	kiled	by	the	Toilet	Of	Doom.

I	found	a	big	container	and	filed	it	with	a	bit	of	water,	then	added	the	dried	shit.
Since	then,	I’ve	added	my	own	shit	to	it	as	wel.	The	worse	it	smels,	the	more
successful	things	are	going.	That’s	the	bacteria	at	work!

Once	I	get	some	Martian	soil	in	here,	I	can	mix	in	the	shit	and	spread	it	out.
Then	I	can	sprinkle	the	Earth	soil	on	top.	You	might	not

think	that	would	be	an	important	step,	but	it	is.	There	are	dozens	of	species	of

bacteria	living	in	Earth	soil,	and	they're	critical	to	plant	growth.	They'l	spread
out	and	breed	like...	wel,	like	a	bacterial	infection..

Within	a	week,	the	Martian	soil	wil	be	ready	for	plants	to	germinate	in.	But	I
won’t	plant	yet.	I’l	spread	it	out	over	a	doubled	area.	It’l

“infect”	the	new	Martian	soil.	After	another	week,	I’l	double	it	again.	And	so	on.
Of	course,	al	the	while,	I’l	be	adding	al	new	manure	to	the	effort.

My	asshole	is	doing	as	much	to	keep	me	alive	as	my	brain.

This	isn’t	a	new	concept	I	just	came	up	with.	People	have	speculated	on	how	to
make	crop	soil	out	of	Martian	dirt	for	decades.	I’l	just

be	putting	it	to	the	test	for	the	first	time.

I	searched	through	the	food	supplies	and	found	al	sorts	of	things	that	I	can	plant.
Peas,	for	instance.	Plenty	of	beans,	too.	I	also	found	several	potatoes.	If	*any*	of
them	can	stil	germinate	after	their	ordeal,	that’l	be	great.	With	a	nearly	infinite
supply	of	vitamins,	al	I	need	are	calories	of	any	kind	to	survive.

The	total	floor-space	of	the	Hab	is	about	92	square	meters.	I	plan	to	dedicate	al
of	it	to	this	endeavor.	I	don’t	mind	walking	on	dirt.

It’l	be	a	lot	of	work,	but	I’m	going	to	need	to	cover	the	entire	floor	to	a	depth	of
10	cm.	That	means	I’l	have	to	transport	9.2	cubic	meters	of	Martian	soil	in	to	the
Hab.	I	can	get	maybe	1/10th	of	a	cubic	meter	in	through	the	airlock	at	a	time,
and	it’l	be	backbreaking	work	to	colect	it.	But	in	the	end,	if	everything	goes	to
plan,	I’l	have	92	square	meters	of	croppable	soil.

Hel	yeah	I’m	a	botanist!	Fear	my	botany	powers!

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	15

Ugh!	This	is	backbreaking	work!

I	spent	12	hours	today	on	EVAs	to	bring	dirt	in	to	the	Hab.	I	only	managed	to
cover	a	smal	corner	of	the	base,	maybe	5	square

meters.	At	this	rate	it’l	take	me	weeks	to	get	al	the	soil	in.	But	hey,	time	is	one

thing	I’ve	got.

The	first	few	EVAs	were	pretty	inefficient;	me	filing	smal	containers	and
bringing	them	in	through	the	airlock.	Then	I	got	wise	and	just	put	one	big
container	in	the	airlock	itself	and	filed	that	with	smal	containers	til	it	was	ful.
That	sped	things	up	a	lot	because	the	airlock	takes	about	10	minutes	to	get
through.

I	ache	al	over.	And	the	shovels	I	have	are	made	for	taking	samples,	not	heavy
digging.	My	back	is	kiling	me.	I	foraged	in	the	medical

supplies	and	found	some	Vicodin.	I	took	it	about	10	minutes	ago.	Should	be
kicking	in	soon.

Anyway,	it’s	nice	to	see	progress.	Time	to	start	getting	the	bacteria	to	work	on
these	minerals.	After	lunch.	No	3/4	ration	today.	I’ve

earned	a	ful	meal.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	16

One	complication	I	hadn’t	though	of:	Water.

Turns	out	being	on	the	surface	of	Mars	for	a	few	milion	years	eliminates	al	the
water	in	the	soil.	My	master’s	degree	in	botany	makes

me	pretty	sure	plants	need	wet	dirt	to	grow	in.	Not	to	mention	the	bacteria	that
has	to	live	in	it	first.

Fortunately,	I	have	water.	But	not	as	much	as	I	want.	To	be	viable,	soil	needs	40
liters	of	water	per	cubic	meter.	My	overal	plan	cals

for	9.2	cubic	meters	of	soil.	So	I’l	eventualy	need	368	liters	of	water	to	feed	it.

The	Hab	has	an	excelent	Water	Reclaimer.	Best	technology	available	on	Earth.
So	NASA	figured	“why	send	a	lot	of	water	up	there?

Just	send	enough	for	an	emergency.”	Humans	need	3	liters	of	water	per	day	to	be
comfortable.	They	gave	us	50	liters	each.	There	are	300

liters	total	in	the	Hab.

Looks	like	I	won’t	be	able	to	cover	the	whole	surface	of	the	Hab	with	fertile	soil.
I’m	wiling	to	dedicate	al	but	an	emergency	50	liters	to	the	cause.	That	means	I
can	feed	62.5	square	meters	at	a	depth	of	10cm.	About	2/3	of	the	Hab’s	floor.	It’l
have	to	do.	Anyway,	I’ve

only	got	a	paltry	5	square	meters	covered	at	the	moment.

After	that,	things	got	disgusting.	I	spent	three	hours	spreading	shit	on	Martian
sand.	I	didn’t	have	to	do	it	with	my	hands,	at	least.

I	spread	the	sand	out	in	a	corner	of	the	Hab,	about	10cm	thick.	I	wadded	up	a
few	blankets	and	uniforms	from	my	departed

crewmates	to	serve	as	one	edge	of	a	planter	box	(with	the	curved	wals	of	the	Hab
being	the	rest	of	the	perimeter).	Then	I	sacrificed	20

liters	of	precious	water	to	the	dirt	gods.

5	square	meters	was	about	right	for	the	amount	of	manure	I	had	handy.	I	dumped
my	big	container	o’	shit	on	to	the	soil	and	nearly

puked	from	the	smel.

That	smel’s	going	to	stick	around	for	a	while,	too.	It’s	not	like	I	can	open	a
window.	Stil,	you	get	used	to	it.	I	mixed	this	soil	and	shit	together	with	a	shovel,
and	spread	it	out	evenly	again.	Then	I	sprinkled	the	Earth	soil	on	top.	Get	to
work,	bacteria.	I’m	counting	on	you.

In	other	news,	today	is	Thanksgiving.	My	family	wil	be	gathering	in	Chicago	for
the	usual	feast	at	my	parent's	house.	My	guess	is	it

won't	be	much	fun,	what	with	me	having	died	11	days	ago.	Hel,	they	probably
just	got	done	gathering	for	my	funeral.

I	wonder	if	they'l	ever	find	out	what	realy	happened.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	22

Wow.	Things	realy	came	along.

I	got	al	the	sand	in	and	ready	to	go.	2/3	of	the	base	is	now	dirt.	And	today	I
executed	my	first	dirt-doubling.	It's	been	a	week,	and	the	former	Martian	soil
was	rich	and	lovely.	Two	more	doublings	and	I	wil	have	covered	the	whole	field.

Al	that	work	was	great	for	my	morale.	It	gave	me	something	to	do.	But	after
things	settled	down	a	bit,	and	I	had	dinner	while	listening

to	Johanssen’s	Beatles	music	colection,	I	got	depressed	again.

Doing	the	math,	this	won’t	keep	me	from	starving.

My	best	bet	for	making	calories	is	potatoes.	They	grow	prolificaly	and	have	a
reasonable	caloric	content	(770	calories	per	kg).	I’m

pretty	sure	the	ones	I	have	wil	germinate.	Problem	is	I	can’t	grow	enough	of
them.	In	62	square	meters,	I	could	grow	maybe	150kg	of

potatoes	in	400	days	(the	time	I	have	before	running	out	of	food).	That’s	a	grand
total	of	115,500	calories,	a	sustainable	average	of	288

calories	per	day.	With	my	height	and	weight,	if	I’m	wiling	to	starve	a	little,	I
need	1500	calories	per	day.

Not	even	close.

So	I	can’t	just	live	off	the	land	for	ever.	But	I	can	extend	my	life.	The	potatoes
wil	last	me	76	days.

Potatoes	grow	continualy,	so	in	those	76	days,	I	can	grow	another	22,000
calories	of	potatoes,	which	wil	tide	me	over	for	another	15

days.	After	that,	it’s	kind	of	pointless	to	continue	the	trend.	Al	told	it	buys	me
about	90	days.

So	now	I’l	start	starving	to	death	on	Sol	490	instead	of	Sol	400.	It’s	progress,	but
any	hope	of	survival	rests	on	me	surviving	until	Sol	1412,	when	Ares	4	wil	land.

There’s	about	a	thousand	days	of	food	I	don’t	have.	And	I	don’t	have	a	plan	for

how	to	get	it.

Shit.

Remember	those	old	math	questions	you	had	in	Algebra	class?	Where	water	is
entering	a	container	at	a	certain	rate	and	leaving	at	a

different	rate	and	you	need	to	figure	out	when	it’l	be	empty?	Wel,	that	concept	is
critical	to	the	“Mark	Watney	doesn’t	die”	project	I’m	working	on.

I	need	to	create	calories.	And	I	need	enough	to	last	four	years.	I	figure	if	I	don’t
get	rescued	by	Ares	4,	I’m	dead	anyway.	So	that’s	my	target:	four	years.

I	have	plenty	of	multivitamins;	over	double	what	I	need.	And	there’s	five	times
the	minimum	protein	in	each	food	pack,	so	careful

rationing	of	portions	takes	care	of	my	protein	needs	for	at	least	four	years.	My
general	nutrition	is	taken	care	of.	I	just	need	calories.

I	need	1500	calories	every	day.	I	have	400	days	of	food	to	start	off	with.	So	how
many	calories	do	I	need	to	generate	per	day	along

the	entire	time	period	to	stay	alive	for	1400	days	total	(the	time	til	Ares	4
arrives)?

I’l	spare	you	the	math.	The	answer	is	a	cool	1000.	I	need	to	create	1000	calories
per	day	with	my	farming	efforts	to	survive	until	Ares

4	gets	here.	Actualy,	a	little	more	than	that,	because	it’s	sol	25	right	now	and	I
haven’t	actualy	planted	anything	yet.

With	my	62	square	meters	of	farmland,	I’l	be	able	to	create	about	288	calories
per	day.	I	need	to	bring	that	up	to	1000.	I	need	four

times	my	current	plan’s	production	to	survive.

I	need	more	surface	area	for	farming,	and	I	need	water	to	hydrate	the	soil.	So
let’s	take	the	problems	one	at	a	time.

How	much	farmland	can	I	realy	make?

There	are	92	square	meters	in	the	Hab.	Let’s	say	I	could	make	use	of	al	of	it.

Also,	there	are	five	unused	bunks.	Let’s	say	I	put	soil	in	on	them,	too.	They’re	2
square	meters	each,	giving	me	10	more	square	meters.

So	we’re	up	to	102.

The	Hab	has	three	lab	tables,	each	about	2	square	meters.	I	want	to	keep	one	for
my	own	use,	leaving	two	for	the	cause.	That’s

another	four	square	meters,	bringing	the	total	to	106.

I	have	two	Martian	rovers.	They	have	pressure	seals,	alowing	the	occupants	to
drive	in	ease,	without	spacesuits,	as	they	spent	long

periods	traversing	the	surface.	They’re	too	cramped	to	plant	crops	in,	and	I	want
to	be	able	to	drive	them	around	anyway.	But	both	rovers	have	an	emergency
pop-tent.

There	are	a	lot	of	problems	with	using	pop-tents	as	farmland,	but	they	have	10
square	meters	of	floor	space	each.	Presuming	I	can

overcome	the	problems,	they	net	me	another	20	square	meters,	bringing	my
farmland	up	to	126.

126	square	meters	of	farmable	land.	That’s	something	to	work	with.	Not	nearly
enough	water	to	moisten	the	soil,	but	like	I	said,	one

thing	at	a	time.

The	next	thing	to	consider	is	how	efficient	I	can	be	in	growing	potatoes.	I	based
my	crop	yield	estimates	on	the	potato	industry	back	on	Earth.	But	potato	farmers
aren’t	in	a	desperate	race	for	survival	like	I	am.	Can	I	get	a	better	yield?

For	starters,	I	can	give	attention	to	each	individual	plant.	I	can	trim	them	and
keep	them	healthy	and	not	interfering	with	each	other.

Also,	as	their	flowering	bodies	breach	the	surface,	I	can	replant	them	deeper,

then	plant	younger	plants	above	them.	For	normal	potato

farmers,	it’s	not	worth	doing	because	they’re	working	with	literaly	milions	of
potato	plants.

Also,	this	sort	of	farming	annihilates	the	soil.	Any	farmer	doing	it	would	turn
their	land	into	a	dust	bowl	within	12	years.	It’s	not

sustainable.	But	who	gives	a	shit?	I	just	need	to	survive	four	years.

I	estimate	I	can	get	50%	higher	yield	by	using	these	tactics.	And	with	the	126
square	meter	farmland	(just	over	double	the	62	square

meters	I	have)	it	works	out	to	be	over	900	calories	per	day.

That’s	real	progress.	I’d	stil	be	in	danger	of	starvation,	but	it	gets	me	in	the	range
of	survival.	I	might	be	able	to	make	it	by	nearly	starving	but	not	quite	dying.	I
could	reduce	my	caloric	use	by	minimizing	manual	labor.	I	could	set	the
temperature	of	the	Hab	higher	than	normal,	meaning	my	body	expends	less
energy	keeping	its	temperature.	I	could	cut	off	an	arm	and	eat	it,	gaining	me
valuable	calories	and	reducing	my	overal	caloric	need.

No,	not	realy.

So	let’s	say	I	could	clear	up	that	much	farmland.	Seems	reasonable.	Where	do	I
get	the	water?	To	go	from	62	to	126	square	meters	of

farmland	at	10cm	deep,	I’l	need	6.4	more	cubic	meters	of	soil	(more	shoveling,
whee!)	and	that’l	need	over	250	liters	of	water.

The	50L	I	have	is	for	me	to	drink	if	the	Water	Reclaimer	breaks.	So	I’m	250L
short	of	my	250L	goal.

Bleh.	I’m	going	to	bed.

I	was	sick	of	thinking,	so	instead	of	trying	to	figure	out	where	I’l	get	250L	of

water,	I	did	some	manual	labor.	I	need	to	get	a	whole

assload	more	soil	in	to	the	Hab,	even	if	it	is	dry	and	useless	right	now.

I	got	a	cubic	meter	in	before	getting	exhausted.

Then,	a	minor	dust-storm	dropped	by	for	an	hour	and	covered	the	solar	colectors
with	crap.	So	I	had	to	suit	up	*again*	and	do

*another*	EVA.	I	was	in	a	pissy	mood	the	whole	time.	Sweeping	off	a	huge	field
of	solar	cels	is	boring	and	physicaly	demanding.	But

once	the	job	was	done,	I	came	back	to	my	Little	Hab	on	the	Prairie.

It	was	about	time	for	another	dirt-doubling,	so	I	figured	I	may	as	wel	get	it	over
with.	It	took	an	hour.	One	more	doubling	and	the

usable	soil	wil	al	be	good	to	go.

Also,	I	figured	it	was	time	to	start	up	a	seed	crop.	I’d	doubled	the	soil	enough
that	I	could	afford	to	leave	a	little	corner	of	it	alone.	I	had	12	potatoes	to	work
with.

I	am	one	lucky	son-of-a-bitch	they	aren’t	freeze-dried	or	mulched.	Why	did
NASA	send	12	whole	potatoes,	refrigerated	but	not

frozen?	And	why	send	them	along	with	us	as	in-pressure	cargo	rather	than	in	a
crate	with	the	rest	of	the	Hab	supplies?	Because

Thanksgiving	was	going	to	happen	while	we	were	doing	surface	operations,	and
NASA’s	shrinks	thought	it	would	be	good	to	make	a	meal

together.	Not	just	to	eat	it,	but	to	actualy	prepare	it.	There’s	probably	some	logic
to	that,	but	who	cares?

I	cut	each	potato	in	to	4	pieces,	making	sure	each	piece	had	at	least	2	eyes.	The
eyes	are	where	they	sprout	from.	I	let	them	sit	for	a

few	hours	to	harden	a	bit,	then	planted	them,	wel	spaced	apart,	in	the	corner.
God	speed,	little	taters.	My	life	depends	on	you.

Normaly,	it	takes	90	days	to	yield	ful	sized	potatoes.	But	I	can’t	wait	that	long.
I’l	need	to	cut	up	al	the	potatoes	from	this	crop	to

seed	the	rest	of	the	field.

By	setting	the	Hab	temperature	to	a	balmy	25.5C,	the	plants	wil	grow	quicker.
Also,	the	internal	lights	wil	provide	plenty	of	“sunlight”

and	I’l	make	sure	they	get	lots	of	water	(once	I	figure	out	where	to	get	water).
There	wil	be	no	foul	weather,	or	any	parasites	to	hassle	them,	or	any	weeds	to
compete	with	for	soil	or	nutrients.	With	al	this	going	for	them,	they	should	yield
healthy,	sproutable	tubers	within	40

days.

I	figured	that	was	enough	being	Farmer	Mark	for	one	day.

A	ful	meal	for	dinner.	I’d	earned	it.	Plus,	I’d	burned	a	ton	of	calories	and	I
wanted	them	back.

I	rifled	through	Commander	Lewis’s	stuff	until	I	found	her	personal	data-stick.
Everyone	got	to	bring	whatever	digital	entertainment

they	wanted,	and	I	was	tired	of	listening	to	Johanssen’s	Beatles	Albums	for	now.
Time	to	see	what	Lewis	had.

Crappy	TV	shows.	That’s	what	she	had.	Countless	entire	runs	of	TV	shows	from
forever	ago.

Wel.	Beggars	can’t	be	choosers.	“Three’s	Company”	it	is.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	29

Over	the	last	few	days,	I	got	al	the	dirt	in	that	I’d	need.	I	prepped	the	tables	and
bunks	for	holding	the	weight	of	soil,	and	even	put	the	dirt	in	place.	There’s	stil
no	water	to	make	it	viable,	but	I	have	some	ideas.	Realy	bad	ideas,	but	they’re
ideas.

Today’s	big	accomplishment	was	setting	up	the	pop-tents.

The	problem	with	the	rovers’	pop-tents	is	they	weren’t	designed	for	frequent	use.

The	idea	was	you’d	throw	out	a	pop-tent,	get	in,	and	wait	for	rescue.	The	airlock
is	nothing	more	than	valves	and	two	doors.	Equalize

the	airlock	with	your	side	of	it,	get	in.	equalize	with	the	other	side,	get	out.	This
means	you	lose	a	lot	of	air	each	use.	And	I’l	need	to	get	in	there	at	least	once	a
day.	The	total	volume	of	each	pop	tent	is	pretty	low,	so	I	can’t	afford	to	lose	air
from	it.

I	spent	*hours*	trying	to	figure	out	how	to	attach	a	pop-tent	airlock	to	a	Hab
airlock.	I	have	three	airlocks	in	the	Hab.	I’d	be	wiling	to	dedicate	two	to	pop-
tents.	That	would	have	been	awesome.

The	frustrating	part	is	pop-tent	airlocks	*can*	attach	to	other	airlocks!	You	might
have	injured	people	in	there,	or	not	enough	space

suits.	You	need	to	be	able	to	get	people	out	without	exposing	them	to	the	Martian
atmosphere.

But	the	pop-tents	were	designed	for	your	crewmates	to	come	rescue	you	in	a
*rover*.	The	airlocks	on	the	Hab	are	much	larger	and

completely	different	than	the	airlocks	on	the	rovers.	When	you	think	about	it,
there’s	realy	no	reason	to	attach	a	pop-tent	to	the	Hab.

Unless	you’re	stranded	on	Mars	and	everyone	thinks	you’re	dead	and	you’re	in	a
desperate	fight	against	time	and	the	elements	to	stay

alive.	But,	you	know,	other	than	that	edge	case	there’s	no	reason.

So	I	finaly	decided	I’d	just	take	the	hit.	I’l	be	losing	some	air	every	time	I	enter
or	exit	a	pop-tent.	The	good	news	is	each	pop-tent

has	an	air	feed	valve	on	the	outside.	Remember,	these	are	emergency	shelters.
The	occupants	might	need	air,	and	you	can	provide	it	from	a	rover	by	hooking	up
an	air	line.	It’s	nothing	more	than	a	tube	that	equalizes	the	rover’s	air	with	the
pop-tent’s.

The	Hab	and	the	rovers	use	the	same	valve	and	tubing	standards,	so	I	was	able	to

attach	the	pop	tents	directly	to	the	Hab.	That'l

automaticaly	replenish	the	air	I	lose	with	my	entries	and	exits	(what	we	NASA
folk	cal	ingress	and	egress).

NASA	was	not	fucking	around	with	these	emergency	tents.	The	moment	I
pushed	the	panic	button	in	the	rover,	there	was	an	ear-

popping	whoosh	as	the	pop-tent	fired	out,	attached	to	the	rover	airlock.	It	took
about	two	seconds.

I	closed	the	airlock	from	the	rover	side	and	ended	up	with	a	nice,	isolated	pop-
tent.	Setting	up	the	equalizer	hose	was	trivial	(for	once	I’m	using	equipment	the
way	it	was	designed	to	be	used).	Then,	after	a	few	trips	through	the	airlock	(with
the	air-loss	automaticaly

equalized	by	the	Hab)	I	got	the	dirt	in.

I	repeated	the	process	for	the	other	tent.	Everything	went	realy	easily.

Sigh…	water.

In	high	school,	I	played	a	lot	of	Dungeons	and	Dragons.	(You	may	not	have
guessed	this	Botanist	/	Mechanical	Engineer	was	a	bit	of	a

nerd	in	high	school,	but	indeed	I	was).	In	the	game	I	played	a	Cleric.	One	of	the
magic	spels	I	could	cast	was	“Create	Water”.	I	always

thought	it	was	a	realy	stupid	spel,	and	it	never	came	up.	Boy	what	I	wouldn’t
give	to	be	able	to	do	that	in	real	life	right	now.

Anyway.	That’s	a	problem	for	tomorrow.

For	tonight,	I	have	to	get	back	to	“Three’s	Company.”	I	stopped	last	night	in	the
middle	of	the	episode	where	Mr.	Roper	saw

something	and	took	it	out	of	context.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	30

I	have	an	idioticaly	dangerous	plan	for	getting	the	water	I	need.	And	boy	do	I

mean	*dangerous*.	But	I	don’t	have	much	choice.	I’m

out	of	ideas	and	I’m	due	for	another	dirt-doubling	in	a	few	days.	When	I	do	the
final	doubling,	I’l	be	doubling	on	to	al	that	new	soil	I’ve	brought	in.	If	I	don’t
wet	it	first,	it’l	just	die.

There	isn’t	a	lot	of	water	here	on	Mars.	There’s	ice	at	the	poles,	but	they’re	too
far	away.	If	I	want	water	I’l	have	to	make	it	from

scratch.	Fortunately,	I	know	the	recipe:	Take	hydrogen.	Add	oxygen.	Burn.

Let’s	take	them	one	at	a	time.	I’l	start	with	oxygen.

I	have	a	fair	bit	of	O2	reserves,	but	not	enough	to	make	250	liters	of	water.	Two
high-pressure	tanks	at	one	end	of	the	Hab	are	my

entire	supply	(plus	the	air	in	the	Hab	of	course).	They	each	contain	25	liters	of
liquid	O2.	The	Hab	would	only	use	them	in	an	emergency;	it	has	the	Oxygenator
to	balance	the	atmosphere.	The	reason	the	O2	tanks	are	here	is	to	feed	the
spacesuits	and	rovers.

Anyway,	the	reserve	oxygen	would	only	be	enough	to	make	100L	of	water	(50L
of	O2	makes	100L	of	molecules	that	only	have	one

O	each).	That	would	mean	no	EVAs	for	me,	and	no	emergency	reserves.	And	it
would	make	less	than	half	the	water	I	need.	Out	of	the

question.

But	oxygen’s	easier	to	find	on	Mars	than	you	might	think.	The	atmosphere	is
98%	CO2.	And	I	happen	to	have	a	machine	whose	sole

purpose	is	liberating	oxygen	from	CO2.	Yay	Oxygenator!

One	problem:	The	atmosphere	is	very	thin.	About	1/90th	the	pressure	on	Earth.
So	it’s	hard	to	colect.	Getting	air	from	outside	to

inside	is	nearly	impossible.	The	whole	purpose	of	the	Hab	is	to	keep	that	sort	of
thing	from	happening.	The	tiny	amount	of	Martian

atmosphere	that	enters	when	I	use	an	airlock	is	laughable.

That’s	where	the	MAV	fuel	plant	comes	in.

My	crewmates	took	the	MAV	away	weeks	ago.	But	the	bottom	half	of	it	stayed
behind.	NASA	is	not	in	the	habit	of	putting

unnecessary	shit	in	to	orbit.	It	left	the	landing	gear,	ingress	ramp,	and	fuel	plant
behind.	Remember	how	the	MAV	made	its	own	fuel	with	help	from	the	Martian
atmosphere?	Step	one	of	that	is	to	colect	CO2	and	store	it	in	a	high	pressure
vessel.	Once	I	get	that	hooked	up	to	the	Hab’s	power,	it’l	give	me	half	a	liter	of
liquid	CO2	per	hour,	indefinitely.	After	5	days	it’l	have	made	125L	of	CO2,
which	wil	make	125L	of	O2	after	I	feed	it	through	the	Oxygenator.

That’s	enough	to	make	250L	of	water.	So	I	have	a	plan	for	oxygen.

The	hydrogen	wil	be	a	little	trickier.

I	considered	raiding	the	hydrogen	fuel-cels,	but	I	need	those	batteries	to	maintain
power	at	night.	If	I	don’t	have	that,	It’l	get	too	cold.

I	could	bundle	up,	but	the	cold	would	kil	my	crops.	And	each	fuel	cel	only	has	a
smal	amount	of	H2	anyway.	It’s	just	not	worth	sacrificing	so	much	usefulness	for
so	little	gain.	The	one	thing	I	have	going	for	me	is	that	energy	is	not	a	problem.	I
don’t	want	to	give	that	up.

So	I’l	have	to	go	a	different	route.

I	often	talk	about	the	MAV.	But	now	I	want	to	talk	about	the	MDV.

During	the	most	terrifying	23	minutes	of	my	life,	four	of	my	crewmates	and	I
tried	not	to	shit	ourselves	while	Martinez	piloted	the	MDV

down	to	the	surface.	It	was	kind	of	like	being	in	a	tumble-dryer.

First,	we	descended	from	Hermes,	and	decelerated	our	orbital	velocity	so	we
could	start	faling	properly.	Everything	was	smooth	until

we	hit	the	atmosphere.	If	you	think	turbulence	is	rough	in	a	jetliner	going
720kph,	just	imagine	what	it’s	like	at	28,000kph.

Several	staged	sets	of	chutes	deployed	automaticaly	to	slow	our	descent,	then
Martinez	manualy	piloted	us	to	the	ground,	using	the

thrusters	to	slow	descent	and	control	our	lateral	motion.	He’d	trained	for	this	for
years,	and	he	did	his	job	extraordinarily	wel.	He

exceeded	al	plausible	expectations	of	landings,	putting	us	just	nine	meters	from
the	target.	The	guy	just	plain	owned	that	landing.

Thanks,	Martinez!	You	may	have	saved	my	life!

Not	because	of	the	perfect	landing,	but	because	he	left	so	much	fuel	behind.
Hundreds	of	liters	of	unused	Hydrazine.	Each	molecule	of

Hydrazine	has	four	hydrogen	atoms	in	it.	So	each	liter	of	Hydrazine	has	enough
hydrogen	for	*two*	liters	of	water.

I	did	a	little	EVA	today	to	check.	The	MDV	has	292L	of	juice	left	in	the	tanks.
Enough	to	make	a	almost	600L	of	water!	Way	more

than	I	need!

There’s	just	one	catch:	Liberating	hydrogen	from	Hydrazine	is…	wel…	it's	how
rockets	work.	It’s	realy,	realy	hot.	And	dangerous.	If

I	do	it	in	an	oxygen	atmosphere,	the	heat	and	newly	liberated	hydrogen	wil
explode.	There’l	be	a	lot	of	H2O	at	the	end,	but	I’l	be	too

dead	to	appreciate	it.

At	its	root,	Hydrazine	is	pretty	simple.	The	Germans	used	it	as	far	back	as	World
War	II	for	rocket-assisted	fighter	fuel	(and

occasionaly	blew	themselves	up	with	it).

Al	you	have	to	do	is	run	it	over	a	catalyst	(which	I	can	extract	from	the	MDV
engine)	and	it	wil	turn	in	to	nitrogen	and	hydrogen.	I’l

spare	you	the	chemistry,	but	the	end	result	is	that	5	molecules	of	Hydrazine
becomes	5	molecules	of	harmless	N2	and	10	molecules	of

lovely	H2.	During	this	process,	it	goes	through	an	intermediate	step	of	being
ammonia.	Chemistry,	being	the	sloppy	bitch	it	is,	ensures

there’l	be	some	ammonia	that	doesn’t	react	with	the	Hydrazine,	so	it’l	just	stay
ammonia.	You	like	the	smel	of	ammonia?	Wel	it’l	be

prevalent	in	my	increasingly	helish	existence.

The	chemistry	is	on	my	side.	The	question	now	is	how	do	I	actualy	make	this
reaction	happen	slowly	and	how	do	I	colect	the

hydrogen?	The	answer	is:	I	don’t	know.

I	suppose	I’l	think	of	something.	Or	die.

Anyway,	much	more	important:	I	simply	can’t	abide	the	replacement	of	Chrissie
with	Cindy.	“Three’s	Company”	may	never	be	the

same	after	this	fiasco.	Time	wil	tel.

Chapter	4

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	32

So	I	ran	in	to	a	bunch	of	problems	with	my	water	plan.

My	idea	is	to	make	600L	of	water	(limited	by	the	hydrogen	I	can	get	from	the
Hydrazine).	That	means	I’l	need	300L	of	liquid	O2.

I	can	create	the	O2	easily	enough.	It	takes	20	hours	for	the	MAV	fuel	plant	to	fil
its	10L	tank	with	CO2.	The	Oxygenator	can	turn	it	in

to	O2,	then	the	Atmospheric	Regulator	wil	see	the	O2	content	in	the	Hab	is	high,
and	pul	it	out	of	the	air,	storing	it	in	the	main	O2	tanks.

They’d	fil	up,	so	I’d	have	to	transfer	O2	over	to	the	rovers’	tanks	and	even	space
suit	tanks	as	necessary.

But	I	can’t	create	it	very	quickly.	At	1/2L	of	CO2	per	hour,	it	wil	take	25	days	to
make	the	oxygen	I	need.	That’s	longer	than	I’d	like.

Also,	there’s	the	problem	of	storing	the	hydrogen.	The	air	tanks	of	the	Hab,	the
rovers,	and	al	the	space	suits	add	up	to	exactly	374L

of	storage.	To	hold	al	the	materials	for	water,	I	would	need	a	whopping	900L	of
storage.

I	considered	using	one	of	the	rovers	as	a	“tank”.	It	would	certainly	be	big
enough,	but	it	just	isn’t	designed	to	hold	in	that	much

pressure.	It’s	made	to	hold	(you	guessed	it)	one	atmosphere.	I	need	vessels	that
can	hold	50	times	that	much.	I’m	sure	a	rover	would	burst.

The	best	way	to	store	the	ingredients	of	water	is	to	make	them	be	water.	So
what’s	what	I’l	have	to	do.

The	concept	is	simple,	but	the	execution	wil	be	incredibly	dangerous.

Every	20	hours,	I’l	have	10L	of	CO2	thanks	to	the	MAV	fuel	plant.	I’l	vent	it	in
to	the	Hab	via	the	highly	scientific	method	of

detaching	the	tank	from	the	MAV	landing	struts,	bringing	it	in	to	the	Hab,	then
opening	the	valve	until	it’s	empty.

The	Oxygenator	wil	turn	it	in	to	oxygen	in	its	own	time.

Then,	I’l	release	Hydrazine,	VERY	SLOWLY,	over	the	iridium	catalyst,	to	turn	it
in	to	N2	and	H2.	I’l	direct	the	hydrogen	to	a	smal

area	and	burn	it.

As	you	can	see,	this	plan	provides	many	opportunities	for	me	to	die	in	a	fiery
explosion.

Firstly,	Hydrazine	is	some	serious	death.	If	I	make	any	mistakes,	there’l	be
nothing	left	but	the	“Mark	Watney	Memorial	Crater”	where

the	Hab	once	stood.

Presuming	I	don’t	fuck	up	with	the	Hydrazine,	there’s	stil	the	matter	of	burning
hydrogen.	I’m	going	to	be	setting	a	fire.	In	the	Hab.	On	purpose.

If	you	asked	every	engineer	at	NASA	what	the	worst	scenario	for	the	Hab	was,
they’d	al	answer	“fire.”	If	you	asked	them	what	the

result	would	be,	they’d	answer	“death	by	fire.”

But	if	I	can	pul	it	off,	I’l	be	making	water	continuously,	with	no	need	to	store
hydrogen	or	oxygen.	It’l	be	mixed	in	to	the	atmosphere

as	humidity,	but	the	Water	Reclaimer	wil	pul	it	out.

I	don’t	even	have	to	perfectly	match	the	Hydrazine	end	of	it	with	the	fuel	plant
CO2	part.	There’s	plenty	of	oxygen	in	the	Hab,	and

plenty	more	in	reserve.	I	just	need	to	make	sure	not	to	make	so	much	water	I	run
myself	out	of	O2.

I	hooked	up	the	MAV	fuel	plant	to	the	Hab’s	power	supply.	Fortunately	they

both	use	the	same	voltage.	It’s	chugging	away,	colecting

CO2	for	me.

Half-ration	for	dinner.	Al	I	accomplished	today	was	thinking	up	a	plan	that’l	kil
me,	and	that	doesn’t	take	much	energy.

I’m	going	to	finish	off	the	last	of	“Three’s	Company”	tonight.	Frankly,	I	like	Mr.
Furley	more	than	the	Ropers.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	33

This	may	be	my	last	entry.

I’ve	known	since	Sol	6	there	was	a	good	chance	I’d	die	here.	But	I	figured	it
would	be	when	I	ran	out	of	food.	I	didn’t	think	it	would

be	this	early.

I’m	about	the	fire	up	the	Hydrazine.

Our	mission	was	designed	knowing	that	anything	might	need	maintenance,	so	I
have	plenty	of	tools.	Even	in	a	space-suit,	I	was	able	to

pry	the	access	panels	off	the	MDV	and	get	at	the	six	Hydrazine	tanks.	I	set	them
in	the	shadow	of	a	rover	to	keep	them	from	heating	up

too	much.	There’s	more	shade	and	a	cooler	temperature	near	the	Hab,	but	fuck
that.	If	they’re	going	to	blow	up,	they	can	blow	up	a	rover,	not	my	house.

Then	I	pried	out	the	reaction	chamber.	It	took	some	work	and	I	cracked	the	damn
thing	in	half,	but	I	got	it	out.	Lucky	for	me	I	don’t

need	a	proper	fuel	reaction.	In	fact,	I	realy,	super-duper	don’t	want	a	proper	fuel
reaction.

I	brought	al	the	Hydrazine	and	reaction	chamber	in.	I	briefly	considered	only
having	one	tank	in	at	a	time	to	reduce	risk.	But	some

back-of-the-napkin	math	told	me	even	one	tank	was	enough	to	blow	the	whole
Hab	up,	so	why	not	bring	them	al	in?

The	tanks	have	manual	vent	valves.	I’m	not	100%	sure	what	they’re	for.
Certainly	we	were	never	expected	to	use	them.	I	think	they’re

there	to	release	pressure	during	the	many	quality	checks	done	during
construction	and	before	fueling.	Whatever	the	reason,	I	have	valves	to	work
with.	Al	it	takes	is	a	wrench.

I	liberated	a	spare	water	hose	from	the	Water	Reclaimer.	With	some	thread	torn
out	of	a	uniform	(Sorry,	Johanssen),	I	attached	it	to

the	valve	output.	Hydrazine	is	a	liquid,	so	al	I	have	to	do	is	lead	it	to	the	reaction
chamber	(more	of	a	“reaction	bowl”	now).

Meanwhile,	the	MAV	fuel	plant	is	stil	working.	I’ve	already	brought	in	one	tank
of	CO2,	vented	it,	and	returned	it	for	refiling.

So	there	are	no	more	excuses.	It’s	time	to	start	making	water.

If	you	find	the	charred	remains	of	the	Hab,	it	means	I	did	something	wrong.	I’m
copying	this	log	over	to	both	rovers	so	it’s	more	likely	it’l	survive.

Here	goes	nothin’

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	33	(2)

Wel,	I	didn’t	die.

First	thing	I	did	was	put	on	the	inner	lining	of	my	EVA	suit.	Not	the	bulky	suit
itself,	just	the	inner	clothing	I	wear	under	it,	including	the	gloves	and	booties.
Then	I	got	an	oxygen	mask	from	the	medical	supplies	and	some	lab	goggles
from	Vogel's	chem	kit.	Almost	al	of	my

body	was	now	protected	and	I	would	be	breathing	canned	air.

Why?	Because	Hydrazine	is	very	toxic.	If	I	breathe	too	much	of	it	I'l	get	major
lung	problems.	If	I	get	it	on	my	skin,	I'l	have	chemical	burns	for	the	rest	of	my
life.	I	wasn't	taking	any	chances.

I	turned	the	valve	until	a	trickle	of	Hydrazine	came	out.	I	let	one	drop	fal	in	to
the	iridium	bowl.

It	un-dramaticaly	sizzled	and	disappeared.

But	hey,	that’s	what	I	wanted.	I	just	freed	up	hydrogen	and	nitrogen.	Yay!

One	thing	I	have	in	abundance	here	is	bags.	They’re	not	much	different	than
kitchen	trash	bags,	though	I’m	sure	they	cost	$50,000

because	NASA.

In	addition	to	being	our	commander,	Lewis	was	also	the	geologist.	She	was
going	to	colect	rock	and	soil	samples	from	al	over	the

operational	area	(10	km	radius).	Weight	limits	restricted	how	much	she	could
actualy	bring	back,	so	she	was	going	to	colect	first,	then	sort	out	the	most
interesting	50kg	to	take	home.	The	bags	are	to	store	and	tag	the	samples.	Some
are	smaler	than	a	Ziploc,	while	others	are	as	big	as	a	Hefty	lawn	and	leaf	bag.

Also,	I	have	duct	tape.	Ordinary	duct	tape,	like	you	buy	at	a	hardware	store.
Turns	out	even	NASA	can’t	improve	on	duct	tape.

I	cut	up	a	few	Hefty	sized	bags	and	taped	them	together	to	make	a	sort	of	tent.
Realy	it	was	more	of	a	super-sized	bag.	I	was	able	to

cover	the	whole	table	where	my	Hydrazine	mad	scientist	set-up	was.	I	put	a	few
knickknacks	on	the	table	to	keep	the	plastic	out	of	the

iridium	bowl.	Thankfuly,	the	bags	are	clear,	so	I	can	stil	see	what’s	going	on.

Next,	I	sacrificed	a	spacesuit	to	the	cause.	I	needed	an	air	hose.	I	have	a	surplus
of	space	suits,	after	al.	A	total	of	seven;	one	for	each	crewmember	and	one	spare.
So	I	don’t	mind	murdering	one	of	them.

I	cut	a	hole	in	the	top	of	the	plastic	and	duct	taped	the	hose	in	place.	Nice	seal,	I
think.

With	some	more	string	from	Johannsen’s	clothing,	I	hung	the	other	end	of	the
hose	from	the	top	of	the	Hab's	dome	by	two	angled

threads	(to	keep	them	wel	clear	of	the	hose	opening).	Now	I	had	a	little	chimney.
The	hose	was	about	1cm	wide.	Hopefuly	a	good

aperture.

The	hydrogen	wil	be	hot	after	the	reaction,	and	it'l	want	to	go	up.	So	I’l	let	it	go
up	the	chimney,	then	burn	it	as	it	comes	out.

Then	I	had	to	invent	fire.

NASA	put	a	lot	of	effort	in	to	making	sure	nothing	here	can	burn.	Everything	is
made	of	metal	or	flame	retardant	plastic	and	the

uniforms	are	synthetic.	I	needed	something	that	could	hold	a	flame,	some	kind	of
pilot	light.	I	don't	have	the	skils	to	keep	enough	H2

flowing	to	feed	a	flame	without	kiling	myself.	Too	narrow	a	margin	there.

After	a	search	of	everyone’s	personal	items	(hey,	if	they	wanted	privacy,	they
shouldn’t	have	abandoned	me	on	Mars	with	their	stuff)	I

found	my	answer.

Martinez	is	a	devout	catholic.	I	knew	that.	What	I	didn’t	know	was	he	brought
along	a	smal	wooden	cross.	I’m	sure	NASA	gave	him

shit	about	it,	but	I	also	know	Martinez	is	one	stubborn	son-of-a-bitch.

I	chipped	his	sacred	religious	item	into	long	splinters	using	a	pair	of	pliers	and	a
screwdriver.	I	figure	if	there’s	a	God,	He	won’t	mind,	considering	the	situation
I’m	in.

Ruining	the	only	religious	icon	I	have	leaves	me	vulnerable	to	Mars	Vampires.
I’l	have	to	risk	it.

There	were	plenty	of	wires	and	batteries	around	to	make	a	spark.	But	you	can’t
just	ignite	wood	with	a	smal	electric	spark.	So	I

colected	ribbons	of	bark	from	local	palm	trees,	then	got	a	couple	of	sticks	and
rubbed	them	together	to	create	enough	friction	to…

No	not	realy.	I	vented	pure	oxygen	at	the	stick	and	gave	it	a	spark.	Fucker	lit	up
like	a	match.

With	my	mini-torch	in	hand,	I	started	a	slow	Hydrazine	flow.	It	sizzled	on	the
iridium	and	disappeared.	Soon	I	had	short	bursts	of	flame	sputtering	from	the
chimney.

The	main	thing	I	had	watch	was	the	temperature.	Hydrazine	breaking	down	is
extremely	exothermic.	So	I’d	do	it	a	bit	at	a	time,

constantly	watching	the	readout	of	a	thermocouple	I’d	attached	to	the	iridium
chamber.

Point	is,	the	process	worked!

Each	Hydrazine	tank	holds	a	little	over	50L,	which	would	be	enough	to	make
100L	of	water.	I’m	limited	by	my	oxygen	production,	but

I’m	al	excited	now,	so	I'm	wiling	to	use	half	my	reserves.	Long	story	short,	I’l
stop	when	the	tank	is	half-empty,	and	I’l	have	50L	or

water	at	the	end!

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	34

Wel	that	took	a	realy	long	time.	I’ve	been	at	it	al	night	with	the	Hydrazine.	But	I
got	the	job	done.

I	could	have	finished	faster,	but	I	figured	caution’s	best	when	setting	fire	to
rocket	fuel	in	an	enclosed	space.

Boy	is	this	place	a	tropical	jungle	now,	I’l	tel	ya.

It’s	almost	30C	in	here,	and	humid	as	al	hel.	I	just	dumped	a	ton	of	heat	and	50L
of	water	in	to	the	air.

During	this	process,	the	poor	Hab	had	to	be	the	mother	of	a	messy	toddler.	It’s
been	replacing	the	oxygen	I’ve	used,	and	the	Water

Reclaimer	is	trying	to	get	the	humidity	down	to	sane	levels.	Nothing	to	be	done
about	the	heat.	There’s	actualy	no	air-conditioning	in	the	Hab.	Mars	is	cold.
Getting	rid	of	excess	heat	isn’t	something	we	expected	to	deal	with.

I’ve	now	grown	accustomed	to	the	alarms	that	are	blaring	at	al	times.	The	fire
alarm	has	finaly	stopped,	now	that	there’s	no	more	fire.

The	low	oxygen	alarm	should	stop	soon.	The	high	humidity	alarm	wil	take	a
little	longer.	The	Water	Reclaimer	has	its	work	cut	out	for	it	today.

For	a	moment,	there	yet	another	alarm.	The	Water	Reclaimer’s	main	tank	was
ful.	Booyah!	That’s	the	kind	of	problem	I	want	to	have!

Remember	the	spacesuit	I	vandalized	yesterday?	I	hung	it	on	its	rack	and	carried
buckets	of	water	to	it	from	the	reclaimer.	It	can	hold

an	atmosphere	of	air	in.	It	should	be	able	to	handle	a	few	buckets	of	water.

Man	I’m	tired.	Been	up	al	night	and	it’s	time	to	sleep.	But	I’l	drift	off	to
dreamland	in	the	best	mood	I’ve	been	in	since	Sol	6.

Things	are	finaly	going	my	way.	In	fact,	they’re	going	great!	I	have	a	chance	to
live	after	al!

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	37

I	am	fucked	and	I’m	gonna	die!

Ok,	calm	down.	I’m	sure	I	can	get	around	this.

I’m	writing	this	log	to	you,	dear	future	Mars	archeologist,	from	Rover	2.	You
may	wonder	why	I’m	not	in	the	Hab	right	now.	Because	I

fled	in	terror,	that’s	why!	And	I’m	not	sure	what	the	hel	to	do	next.

I	guess	I	should	explain	what	happened.	If	this	is	my	last	entry,	you’l	at	least
know	why.

Over	the	past	few	days,	I've	been	happily	making	water.	It’s	been	going
swimmingly.	(See	what	I	did	there?	“swimmingly”)

I	even	beefed	up	the	MAV	fuel	plant	compressor.	It	was	very	technical	(I
increased	the	voltage	to	the	pump).	So	I’m	making	water

even	faster	now.

After	my	initial	burst	of	50L,	I	decided	to	settle	down	and	just	make	it	at	the	rate
I	get	O2.	I’m	not	wiling	to	go	below	a	25L	reserve.

So	when	I	dip	too	low,	I	stop	dicking	with	Hydrazine	until	I	get	the	O2	back	up
to	wel	above	25L.

Important	note:	When	I	say	I	made	50L	of	water,	that	was	an	assumption.	I
didn’t	*reclaim*	50L	of	water.	The	additional	soil	I’d	filed

the	Hab	with	was	extremely	dry	and	greedily	sucked	up	a	lot	of	the	humidity.
That’s	where	I	want	the	water	to	go	anyway,	so	I’m	not

worried,	and	I	wasn’t	surprised	when	the	reclaimer	didn’t	get	anywhere	near
50L.

I	get	10L	of	CO2	every	15	hours	now	that	I	souped	up	the	pump.	I’ve	done	this
process	four	times.	My	math	tels	me	that,	including

my	initial	50L	burst,	I	should	have	130L	of	water	added	to	the	system.

Wel	my	math	is	a	damn	liar!

I’ve	gained	70L	in	the	water	regulator	and	the	spacesuit-now-watertank.	There’s
plenty	of	condensation	on	the	wals	and	domed	roof,

and	the	soil	is	certainly	absorbing	its	fair	share.	But	that	doesn’t	account	for	60L
of	missing	water.	Something	was	wrong.

That’s	when	I	noticed	the	other	O2	tank.

The	Hab	has	two	reserve	O2	tanks.	One	on	each	side	of	the	structure,	for	safety
reasons.	The	Hab	can	decide	which	one	to	use

whenever	it	wants.	Turns	out	it’s	been	topping	off	the	atmosphere	from	Tank	1.
But	when	I	add	O2	to	the	system	(via	the	Oxygenator),	the	Hab	evenly
distributes	the	gain	among	the	two	tanks.	Tank	2	has	been	slowly	gaining
oxygen.

That’s	not	a	problem,	it’s	just	doing	its	job.	But	it	does	mean	I’ve	been	gaining
O2	over	time.	Which	means	I’m	not	consuming	it	as	fast	as	I	thought.

At	first,	I	thought	“Yay!	More	oxygen!	Now	I	can	make	water	faster!”	But	then	a
more	disturbing	thought	occurred	to	me.

Folow	my	logic:	I’m	gaining	O2.	But	the	amount	I’m	bringing	in	from	outside	is
constant.	So	the	only	way	to	“gain”	it	is	to	be	using	less	than	I	thought.	But	I’ve
been	doing	the	Hydrazine	reaction	with	the	assumption	that	I	was	using	al	of	it.

The	only	possible	explanation	is	I	haven’t	been	burning	al	the	released	hydrogen.

It’s	obvious	now,	in	retrospect.	But	it	never	occurred	to	me	that	some	of	the
hydrogen	just	wouldn’t	burn.	It	got	past	the	flame,	and

went	on	its	merry	way.	Dammit,	Jim,	I’m	a	botanist,	not	a	chemist!

Chemistry	is	messy,	so	there's	unburned	Hydrogen	in	the	air.	Al	around	me.
Mixed	in	with	the	oxygen.	Just...	hanging	out.	Waiting	for	a

spark	so	it	can	blow	the	fucking	Hab	up!

Once	I	figured	this	out,	and	composed	myself,	I	got	a	Ziploc-sized	sample	bag
and	waved	it	around	a	bit,	then	sealed	it.

Then,	a	quick	EVA	to	a	rover,	where	we	keep	the	atmospheric	analyzers.
Nitrogen:	22%.	Oxygen:	9%.	Hydrogen:	64%.

I’ve	been	hiding	here	in	the	rover	ever	since.

It’s	Hydrogenvile	in	the	Hab.

I’m	very	lucky	it	hasn’t	blown.	Even	a	smal	static	discharge	would	have	led	to
“Oh	the	humanity!”

So,	I’m	here	in	Rover	2.	I	can	stay	for	a	day	or	two,	tops,	before	the	CO2	filters
from	the	rover	and	my	spacesuit	fil	up.	I	have	that

long	to	figure	out	how	to	deal	with	this.

The	Hab	is	now	a	bomb.

Chapter	5

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	38

I’m	stil	cowering	in	the	rover,	but	I’ve	had	time	to	think.	And	I	know	how	to
deal	with	the	hydrogen.

I	thought	about	the	Atmospheric	Regulator.	It	pays	attention	to	what’s	in	the	air
and	balances	it.	That’s	how	the	excess	O2	I've	been

importing	ends	up	in	the	tanks.	Problem	is,	it’s	just	not	built	to	pul	hydrogen	out
of	the	air.

The	regulator	uses	freeze-separation	to	sort	out	the	gasses.	When	it	decides
there’s	too	much	oxygen,	it	starts	colecting	air	in	a	tank

and	cooling	it	to	90	kelvin.	That	makes	the	oxygen	turn	to	liquid,	but	leaves	the
nitrogen	(condensation	point:	77K)	stil	gaseous.	Then	it	stores	the	O2.

But	I	can’t	get	it	to	do	that	for	hydrogen,	because	hydrogen	needs	to	be	below
21K	to	turn	liquid.	And	the	regulator	just	can’t	get

temperatures	that	low.	Dead	end.

Here’s	the	solution:

Hydrogen	is	dangerous	because	it	can	blow	up.	But	it	can	only	blow	up	if	there’s
oxygen	around.	Hydrogen	without	oxygen	is

harmless.	And	the	regulator	is	al	about	puling	oxygen	out	of	the	air.

There	are	four	different	safety	interlocks	that	prevent	the	regulator	from	letting
the	Hab’s	oxygen	content	get	too	low.	But	they’re

designed	to	work	against	technical	faults,	not	deliberate	sabotage	(bwa	ha	ha!).

Long	story	short,	I	can	trick	the	regulator	in	to	puling	al	the	oxygen	out	of	the
Hab.	Then	I	can	wear	a	spacesuit	(so	I	can	breathe)	and	do	whatever	I	want

without	fear	of	blowing	up.	Yay!

I’l	use	an	O2	tank	to	spray	short	bursts	of	oxygen	at	the	hydrogen,	and	make	a
spark	with	a	couple	of	wires	and	a	battery.	It’l	set	the

hydrogen	on	fire,	but	only	until	the	smal	bit	of	oxygen	is	used	up.

I’l	just	do	that	over	and	over,	in	controled	bursts,	until	I’ve	burned	off	al	the
hydrogen.

One	tiny	flaw	with	that	plan:	It’l	kil	my	dirt.

The	dirt	is	only	viable	soil	because	of	the	bacteria	growing	in	it.	If	I	get	rid	of	al
the	oxygen,	the	bacteria	wil	die.	I	don’t	have	100

bilion	little	spacesuits	handy.

It’s	half	a	solution	anyway.

Time	to	take	a	break	from	thinking.

Commander	Lewis	was	the	last	one	to	use	this	rover.	She	was	scheduled	to	use	it
again	on	Sol	7,	but	she	went	home	instead.	Her

personal	travel	kit’s	stil	in	the	back.	Rifling	through	it,	I	found	a	protein	bar	and
a	personal	USB,	probably	ful	of	music	to	listen	to	on	the	drive.

Time	to	chow	down	and	see	what	the	good	Commander	brought	along	for	music.

LOG	ENTRY	SOL	38	(2)

Disco.	God	damn	it,	Lewis.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	39

Wel	I	think	I’ve	got	it.

Soil	bacteria	are	used	to	winters.	They	get	less	active,	and	require	less	oxygen	to
survive.	I	can	lower	the	Hab	temperature	to	1C,	and

they’l	nearly	hibernate.	This	sort	of	thing	happens	on	Earth	al	the	time.	They	can

survive	a	couple	of	days	this	way.	If	you’re	wondering	how	bacteria	survive	long
periods	of	cold	on	Earth,	the	answer	is	they	don’t.	Bacteria	further	underground
where	it	was	warmer	breed

upward	to	replace	the	dead	ones.

They’l	stil	need	some	oxygen,	but	not	much.	I	think	a	1%	content	wil	do	the
trick.	That	leaves	a	little	in	the	air	for	the	bacteria	to

breathe,	but	not	enough	to	maintain	a	fire.	So	the	hydrogen	won’t	blow	up.

But	that	leads	to	yet	another	problem.	The	potato	plants	won’t	like	the	plan.

They	don’t	mind	the	lack	of	oxygen	but	the	cold	wil	kil	them.	So	I’l	have	to	pot
them	(bag	them,	actualy)	and	move	them	to	a	rover.

They	haven’t	even	sprouted	yet,	so	it’s	not	like	they	need	light.

It	was	surprisingly	annoying	to	find	a	way	to	make	the	heat	stay	on	when	the
rover’s	unoccupied.	But	I	figured	it	out.	After	al,	I’ve	got	nothing	but	time	in
here.

So	that’s	the	plan.	First,	bag	the	potato	plants	and	bring	them	to	the	rover	(make
sure	it	keeps	the	damn	heater	on).	Then	drop	the	Hab

temperature	to	1C.	Then	reduce	to	O2	content	to	1%.	Then	burn	off	the
hydrogen	with	a	battery,	some	wires,	and	a	tank	of	O2.

Yeah.	This	al	sounds	like	a	great	idea	with	no	chance	of	catastrophic	failure.

That	was	sarcasm,	by	the	way.

Wel,	off	I	go.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	40

Things	weren’t	100%	successful.

They	say	no	plan	survives	first	contact	with	implementation.	I’d	have	to	agree.
Here’s	what	happened:

I	summoned	up	the	courage	to	return	to	the	Hab.	Once	I	got	there,	I	felt	a	little
more	confident.	Everything	was	how	I’d	left	it	(what	did	I	expect?	Martians
looting	my	stuff?)

It	would	take	a	while	to	let	the	Hab	cool,	so	I	started	that	right	away	by	turning
the	temperature	down	to	1C.

I	bagged	the	potato	plants,	and	got	a	chance	to	check	up	on	them	while	I	was	at
it.	They’re	rooting	nicely	and	about	to	sprout.	One

thing	I	hadn’t	accounted	for	was	how	to	bring	them	from	the	Hab	to	the	rovers.

The	answer	was	pretty	easy.	I	put	al	of	them	in	Martinez’s	spacesuit.	Then	I
dragged	it	out	with	me	to	the	rover	I’d	set	up	as	a

temporary	nursery.

Making	sure	to	jimmy	the	heater	to	stay	on,	I	headed	back	to	the	Hab.

Buy	the	time	I	got	back,	it	was	already	chily.	Down	to	5C	already.	Shivering	and
seeing	my	breath	condense	in	front	of	me,	I	threw	on

extra	layers	of	clothes.	Fortunately	I’m	not	a	very	big	man.	Martinez’s	clothes	fit
over	mine,	and	Vogel’s	fit	over	Martinez’s.	These	shitty	clothes	were	designed	to
be	worn	in	a	temperature-controled	environment.	Even	with	three	layers,	I	was
stil	cold.	I	climbed	in	to	my	bunk	and	under	the	covers	for	more	warmth.

Once	the	temperature	got	to	1C,	I	waited	another	hour,	just	to	make	sure	the
bacteria	in	the	dirt	got	the	memo	that	it	was	time	to	take	it	slow.

The	next	problem	I	ran	in	to	was	the	regulator.	Despite	my	swaggering
confidence,	I	wasn’t	able	to	outwit	it.	It	really	does	not	want	to	pul	too	much	O2
out	of	the	air.	The	lowest	I	could	get	it	to	was	15%.	After	that,	it	flatly	refused	to
go	lower,	and	nothing	I	did	mattered.	I	had	al	these	plans	about	getting	in	and
reprogramming	it.	But	the	safety	protocols	turned	out	to	be	in	ROMs.

I	can’t	blame	it.	Its	whole	purpose	is	to	prevent	the	atmosphere	from	becoming
lethal.	Nobody	at	NASA	thought	“Hey,	let’s	alow	a	fatal	lack	of	oxygen	that	wil
make	everyone	drop	dead!”

So	I	had	to	use	more	a	more	primitive	plan.

The	regulator	uses	a	different	set	of	vents	for	air	sampling	than	it	does	for	main
air	separation.	The	air	that	gets	freeze-separated	comes	in	through	a	single	large
vent	on	the	main	unit.	But	it	samples	the	air	from	nine	smal	vents	that	pipe	back
to	the	main	unit.	That	way	it	gets	a	good	average	of	the	Hab,	and	prevents	one
localized	imbalance	from	throwing	it	off.

I	taped	up	eight	of	the	intakes,	leaving	only	one	of	them	active.	Then	I	taped	the
mouth	of	a	Hefty-sized	bag	over	the	neck-hole	of	a

spacesuit	(Johanssen’s	this	time).	In	the	back	of	the	bag,	I	poked	a	smal	hole	and
taped	it	over	the	remaining	intake.

Then	I	inflated	the	bag	with	pure	O2	from	the	suit’s	tanks.	“Holy	shit!”	the
regulator	thought,	“I	better	pul	O2	out	right	away!”

Worked	great!

I	decided	I	not	to	wear	a	space	suit	after	al.	The	atmospheric	pressure	was	going
to	be	fine.	Al	I	needed	was	oxygen.	So	I	grabbed	an

O2	canister	from	the	medical	bay.	That	way,	I	had	a	hel	of	a	lot	more	freedom	of
motion.	It	even	had	a	rubber	band	to	keep	it	on	my	face!

Though	I	did	need	a	spacesuit	to	monitor	the	actual	Hab	oxygen	level	(The
Hab’s	main	computer	was	convinced	it	was	100%	O2).

Each	spacesuit	knew	how	to	monitor	its	own	internal	air,	of	course.

Let’s	see…	Martinez’s	spacesuit	was	in	the	rover.	Johanssen’s	was	outwitting	the
regulator.	Lewis’s	was	serving	as	a	water-tank.	I

didn’t	want	to	mess	with	mine	(hey,	it’s	custom	fitted!).	That	left	me	three
spacesuits	to	work	with.

I	grabbed	Vogel’s	suit	and	activated	the	internal	air	sensors	while	leaving	the
helmet	off.	Once	the	oxygen	dropped	to	12%	I	put	the

breather	mask	on.	I	watched	it	fal	further	and	further.	When	it	reached	1%	I	cut

power	to	the	regulator.

I	may	not	be	able	to	reprogram	the	regulator,	but	I	can	turn	the	bastard	off
completely.

The	Hab	has	emergency	flashlights	in	many	locations	in	case	of	critical	power
failure.	I	tore	the	L.E.D.	bulbs	out	of	one	and	left	the	two	frayed	power	wires
very	close	together.	Now	when	I	turned	it	on	I	got	a	smal	spark.

Taking	a	canister	of	O2	from	Vogel’s	suit,	I	attached	a	strap	to	both	ends	and
slung	it	over	my	shoulder.	Then	I	attached	an	air	line	to	the	tank	and	crimped	it
with	my	thumb.	I	turned	on	a	very	slow	trickle	of	O2;	a	smal	enough	that	it
couldn’t	overpower	the	crimp.

Standing	on	the	table	with	a	sparker	in	one	hand	and	my	oxygen	line	in	the	other,
I	reached	up	and	gave	it	a	try.

And	holy	hel	it	worked!	Blowing	the	O2	over	the	sparker,	I	flicked	the	switch	on
the	flashlight	and	a	wonderful	jet	of	flame	fired	out	of	the	tube.	The	fire	alarm
went	off,	of	course.	But	I’d	heard	it	so	much	lately	I	barely	noticed	it	any	more.

Then	I	did	it	again.	And	again.	Short	bursts.	Nothing	flashy.	I	was	happy	to	take
my	time.

I	was	elated!	This	was	the	best	plan	ever!	Not	only	was	I	clearing	out	the
hydrogen,	I	was	making	more	water!

Everything	went	great	right	up	to	the	explosion.

One	minute	I	was	happily	burning	hydrogen;	the	next	I	was	on	the	other	side	of
the	Hab	and	a	lot	of	stuff	was	knocked	over.	I

stumbled	to	my	feet	and	saw	the	Hab	in	disarray.

My	first	thought	was	“My	ears	hurt	like	hel!”

Then	I	thought	“I’m	dizzy,”	and	fel	to	my	knees.	Then	I	fel	prone.	I	was	that
dizzy.	I	groped	my	head	with	both	hands,	looking	for	a	head-wound	I
desperately	hoped	would	not	be	there.	Nothing	seemed	to	be	amiss.

But	feeling	al	over	my	head	and	face	revealed	the	true	problem.	My	oxygen
mask	had	been	ripped	off	in	the	blast.	I	was	breathing

nearly	pure	nitrogen.

The	floor	was	covered	in	junk	from	al	over	the	Hab.	No	hope	of	finding	the
medical	O2	tank.	No	hope	of	finding	anything	in	this	mess

before	I	passed	out.

Then	I	saw	Lewis’s	suit	hanging	right	where	it	belonged.	It	hadn’t	moved	in	the
blast.	It	was	heavy	to	start	with	and	had	70L	of	water	in	it.

Rushing	over,	I	quickly	cranked	on	the	O2	and	stuck	my	head	into	the	neck-hole
(I’d	removed	the	helmet	long	ago,	for	easy	access	to

the	water).	I	breathed	a	bit	until	the	dizziness	faded,	then	took	a	deep	breath	and
held	it.

Stil	holding	my	breath,	I	glanced	over	to	the	spacesuit	and	Hefty	bag	I’d	used	to
outsmart	the	regulator.	The	bad	news	is	I’d	never

removed	them.	The	good	news	is	the	explosion	removed	them.	Eight	of	the	nine
intakes	for	the	regulator	were	stil	bagged,	but	this	one

would	at	least	tel	the	truth.

Stumbling	over	to	the	regulator,	I	turned	it	back	on.

After	a	two	second	boot	process	(it	was	made	to	start	up	fast	for	obvious
reasons)	it	immediately	identified	the	problem.

The	shril	low-oxygen	alarm	blared	throughout	the	Hab	as	the	regulator	dumped
pure	oxygen	in	to	the	atmosphere	as	fast	as	it	safely

could.	Separating	oxygen	from	the	atmosphere	is	difficult	and	time	consuming,
but	adding	it	is	as	simple	as	opening	a	valve.

I	clambered	over	debris	back	to	Lewis’s	spacesuit	and	put	my	head	back	in	for
more	good	air.	Within	three	minutes,	the	regulator	had

brought	the	Hab	oxygen	back	up	to	par.

I	noticed	for	the	first	time	how	burned	my	clothing	was.	It	was	a	good	time	to	be
wearing	three	layers	of	clothes.	Mostly	the	damage

was	on	my	sleves.	The	outer	layer	was	gone.	The	middle	layer	was	singed	and
burned	clean	through	in	places.	The	inner	layer,	my	own

uniform,	was	in	reasonably	good	shape.	Looks	like	I	lucked	out	again.

Also,	glancing	at	the	Hab’s	main	computer,	I	see	the	temperature	rose	to	15C.
Something	very	hot	and	very	explodey	happened,	and	I

wasn’t	sure	what.	Or	how.

And	that’s	where	I	am	now.	Wondering	what	the	hel	happened.

After	al	that	work	and	getting	blown	up,	I’m	exhausted.	Tomorrow	I’l	have	to	do
a	milion	equipment	checks	and	try	to	figure	out

what	blew	up,	but	for	now	I	just	want	to	sleep.

I’m	in	the	rover	again	tonight.	Even	with	the	hydrogen	gone,	I’m	reluctant	to
hang	out	in	a	Hab	that	has	a	history	of	exploding	for	no

reason.	Plus,	I	can’t	be	sure	there	isn’t	a	leak.

This	time,	I	brought	a	proper	meal,	and	something	to	listen	to	that	isn’t	disco.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	41

I	spent	the	day	running	ful	diagnostics	on	every	system	in	the	Hab.	It	was
incredibly	boring,	but	my	survival	depends	on	these

machines,	so	it	had	to	be	done.	I	can’t	just	assume	an	explosion	did	no	long-term
damage.

I	did	the	most	critical	tests	first.	Number	one	was	the	integrity	of	the	Hab
canvas.	I	felt	pretty	confident	it	was	in	good	shape,	cause	I’d	spent	a	few	hours
asleep	in	the	rover	before	returning	to	the	Hab,	and	the	pressure	was	stil	good.
The	computer	reported	no	change

pressure	over	that	time,	other	than	a	minor	fluctuation	based	on	temperature.

Then	I	checked	the	Oxygenator.	If	that	stops	working	and	I	can’t	fix	it,	I’m	a
dead	man.	No	problems.

Then	the	Atmospheric	Regulator.	Again,	no	problem.

Heating	unit,	primary	battery	array,	O2	and	N2	storage	tanks,	Water	Reclaimer,
al	three	airlocks,	lighting	systems,	main	computer…

on	and	on	I	went,	feeling	better	and	better	as	each	system	proved	to	be	in	perfect
working	order.

Got	to	hand	it	to	NASA.	They	don’t	fuck	around	when	making	this	stuff.

Then	came	the	critical	part…	checking	the	dirt.	Taking	a	few	samples	from	al
over	the	Hab	(remember,	it’s	al	dirt	flooring	now),	I

made	some	slides.

I	took	them	over	to	the	microscope	and	checked	up	on	my	beloved	bacteria.	I
breathed	a	sigh	of	relief	when	I	saw	healthy,	active

bacteria	doing	their	thing.

Then	I	set	about	cleaning	up	the	mess.	And	I	had	a	lot	of	time	to	think	about
what	had	happened.

So	what	happened?	Wel,	I	have	a	theory.

According	to	the	main	computer,	during	the	blast,	the	internal	pressure	spiked	to
1.4	atmospheres,	and	the	temperature	rose	to	15C	in

under	a	second.	But	the	pressure	quickly	subsided	back	to	1atm.	This	would
make	sense	if	the	Atmospheric	Regulator	were	on,	but	I’d	cut

power	to	it.

The	temperature	remained	15C	for	some	time	afterward,	so	any	heat	expansion
should	stil	have	been	present.	But	the	pressure

dropped	down	again,	so	where	did	that	extra	pressure	go?	Raising	the
temperature	and	keeping	the	same	number	of	atoms	inside	should

permanently	raise	the	pressure.	But	it	didn’t.

I	quickly	realized	the	answer.	The	hydrogen	(the	only	available	thing	to	burn)
combined	with	oxygen	(hence	combustion)	and	became

water.	Water	is	a	thousand	times	as	dense	as	a	gas.	So	the	heat	added	to	the
pressure,	and	the	transformation	of	hydrogen	and	oxygen	in

to	water	brought	it	back	down	again.

The	milion	dolar	question	is:	Where	the	hel	did	the	oxygen	come	from?	The
whole	plan	was	to	limit	oxygen	and	keep	an	explosion

from	happening.	And	it	was	working	for	quite	a	while	before	blowing	up.

I	think	I	have	my	answer.	And	it	comes	down	to	me	brain-farting.	Remember
when	I	decided	not	to	wear	a	spacesuit?	That	decision

almost	kiled	me.

The	medical	O2	tank	mixes	pure	oxygen	with	surrounding	air,	then	feeds	it	to
you	through	a	mask.	The	mask	stays	on	your	face	with	a

little	rubber	band	that	goes	around	the	back	of	your	neck.	Not	an	air-tight	seal.

I	know	what	you’re	thinking.	The	mask	leaked	oxygen.	But	no.	I	was	breathing
the	oxygen.	When	I	was	inhaling,	I	made	a	nearly

airtight	seal	with	the	mask	by	sucking	it	to	my	face.

The	problem	was	the	exhale.	Do	you	know	how	much	oxygen	you	absorb	out	of
the	air	when	you	take	a	normal	breath?	I	don’t	know

either,	but	it’s	not	100%.	With	every	breath,	I	was	taking	in	oxygen,	my	lungs
grabbed	some	of	it,	then	I	was	breathing	it	out	into	the	Hab.

Every	time	I	exhaled,	I	added	more	oxygen	to	the	system.

It	just	didn’t	occur	to	me.	But	it	should	have.	If	your	lungs	grabbed	up	al	the
oxygen,	mouth-to-mouth	resuscitation	wouldn’t	work.	I’m

such	a	dumb-ass	for	not	thinking	of	it!	And	my	dumbassery	almost	got	me	kiled!

I’m	realy	going	to	have	to	be	more	careful.

It’s	a	good	thing	I	burned	off	most	of	the	hydrogen	before	the	explosion.
Otherwise	that	would	have	been	the	end.	As	it	is,	the

explosion	wasn’t	strong	enough	to	pop	the	Hab.	Though	it	was	strong	enough	to
almost	blast	my	eardrums	in.

The	Water	Reclaimer	did	its	job	last	night	and	puled	another	50L	of	water	out	of
the	air.	Long	ago	before	hydrogen	became	the	focus

of	my	life,	my	problem	was	the	60L	shortfal	in	water	production.	50L	of	it	is
now	in	Lewis’s	spacesuit,	which	I’l	cal	“The	Cistern”	from	now	on	because	it
sounds	cooler.	The	other	10L	of	water	was	absorbed	by	the	dry	soil.

Lots	of	physical	labor	today.	I’ve	earned	a	ful	meal.	And	to	celebrate	my	first
night	back	in	the	Hab,	I’l	kick	back	and	watch	some

shitty	20th	century	TV	courtesy	of	Commander	Lewis.

“The	Dukes	of	Hazzard,”	eh?	Let’s	give	it	a	whirl.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	42

I	slept	in	late	today.	I	deserved	it.	After	four	nights	of	awful	sleep	in	the	rover,
my	bunk	felt	like	the	softest,	most	profoundly	beautiful	featherbed	ever	made.

Anyway,	I	dragged	my	ass	out	of	bed	and	finished	some	post-explosion	cleanup.

I	moved	the	potato	plants	back	in	today.	And	just	in	time,	too.	They’re	sprouting.
They	look	healthy	and	happy.	This	isn’t	chemistry,

medicine,	bacteriology,	nutrition	analysis,	explosion	dynamics,	or	any	other	shit
I’ve	been	doing	lately,	this	is	botany.	I’m	sure	I	can	at	least	grow	some	plants
without	fucking	up.

Right?

You	know	what	realy	sucks?	I’ve	only	made	130L	of	water.	I	have	another	470L
to	go.	You’d	think	after	almost	kiling	myself	twice,	I’d	stop	screwing	around
with	hydrazine.	But	nope.	I’l	be	reducing	hydrazine	and	burning	hydrogen	in	the
Hab,	every	10	hours,	for	another	10	days.	Let’s	hope	I	do	a	better	job	of	it	from
now	on.

I’l	have	a	lot	of	dead	time.	10	hours	for	each	tank	of	C02	to	finish	filing.	It	only
takes	20	minutes	to	reduce	the	hydrazine	and	burn	the	hydrogen.	I’l	spend	the
rest	of	the	time	watching	TV.

And	seriously…	It’s	clear	the	General	Lee	can	outrun	a	police	cruiser.	Why
doesn’t	Roscoe	just	go	to	the	Duke	farm	and	arrest	them

when	they’re	not	in	the	car?

Chapter	6

Venkat	returned	to	his	office,	dropped	his	briefcase	on	the	floor,	and	colapsed
into	his	leather	chair.	He	took	a	moment	to	look	out	the	windows	at	his	scenic
view	of	the	Johnson	Space	Center.

Glancing	at	his	computer	screen,	he	noted	47	unread	emails	urgently	demanding
his	attention.	They	could	wait.	Today	had	been	a	sad

day.	Today	was	the	memorial	service	for	Mark	Watney.

The	President	had	given	a	speech,	praising	Watney’s	bravery	and	sacrifice,	and
the	quick	actions	of	Commander	Lewis	in	getting

everyone	else	to	safety.	Commander	Lewis	and	the	surviving	crew,	via	long
range	communication	from	Hermes,	gave	eulogies	to	their

departed	comrade	from	deep	space.	They	had	another	ten	months	of	travel	yet	to
endure.

The	Director	had	given	a	speech	as	wel,	reminding	everyone	that	space	flight	is
incredibly	dangerous,	and	how	we	wil	not	back	down

in	the	face	of	adversity.

During	preparation	for	the	service,	they’d	asked	Venkat	if	he	was	wiling	to	make
a	speech.	He’d	declined.	What	was	the	point?

Watney	was	dead.	Nice	words	form	the	Director	of	Mars	Missions	wouldn’t
bring	him	back.

“You	ok,	Venk?”	came	a	voice	from	the	doorway.

Venkat	swiveled	around.	“Guess	so,”	he	said.

“You	could	have	given	a	speech.”

“I	didn’t	want	to.	You	know	that.”

“Yeah,	I	know.	I	didn’t	want	to,	either.	But	I’m	the	director	of	NASA.	It’s	kind	of
expected.	You	sure	you’re	ok?”

“Yeah,	I’l	be	fine.”

“Good,”	Teddy	said,	walking	in.	“Let’s	get	back	to	work,	then.”

“Sure,”	Venkat	shrugged.	“Let’s	start	with	you	authorizing	my	satelite	time.”

Teddy	leaned	against	the	wal	with	a	sigh.	“This	again.”

“Yes,”	Venkat	said.	“This	again.	What	is	the	problem?”

“Ok,	run	me	through	it.	What,	exactly,	are	you	after?”

Venkat	leaned	forward.	“Ares	3	was	a	failure,	but	we	can	salvage	something
from	it.	We’re	funded	for	five	Ares	missions.	I	think	we

can	get	Congress	to	fund	a	sixth.”

“I	don’t	know,	Venk…”

“It’s	simple,	Teddy,”	Venkat	pressed	on.	“They	evac’d	after	six	sols.	There’s
almost	an	entire	mission	worth	of	supplies	up	there.	It

would	only	cost	a	fraction	of	a	normal	mission.	It	normaly	takes	14	presupply
probes	to	prep	a	site.	We	might	be	able	to	send	what’s

missing	in	three.	Maybe	two.”

“Venk,	the	site	got	hit	by	a	175	km/h	sandstorm.	It’l	be	in	realy	bad	shape.”

“That’s	why	I	want	imagery,”	Venkat	explained.	“I	just	need	a	couple	of	shots	of
the	site.	We	could	learn	a	lot.”

“Like	what?	You	think	we’d	send	people	to	Mars	without	being	sure	everything
was	in	perfect	working	order?”

“Everything	doesn’t	have	to	be	perfect,”	Venkat	said	quickly.	“Whatever’s
broken,	we’d	send	replacements	for.	The	only	thing	that

needs	to	work	is	the	MAV.	And	we’d	have	to	send	a	fresh	one	anyway.”

“How	wil	we	know	from	imagery	what’s	broken?”

“It’s	just	a	first	step.	They	evac’d	because	the	wind	was	a	threat	to	the	MAV,	but
the	Hab	can	withstand	a	lot	more	punishment.	It

might	stil	be	in	one	piece.

“And	it’l	be	realy	obvious.	If	it	popped,	it’d	completely	blow	out	and	colapse.	If
it’s	stil	standing,	then	everything	inside	wil	be	fine.

And	the	rovers	are	solid.	They	can	take	any	sandstorm	Mars	has	to	offer.	Just	let
me	take	a	look,	Teddy,	that’s	al	I	want.”

Teddy	looked	down,	“You’re	not	the	only	guy	who	wants	satelite	time,	you
know.	We	have	Ares	4	supply	missions	coming	up.	We

need	to	concentrate	on	Schiapareli	Crater.”

“I	don't	get	it,	Teddy.	What's	the	problem	here?”	Venkat	asked.	“I’m	talking
about	securing	us	another	mission.	We	have	12	satelites

in	orbit	around	Mars,	I’m	sure	you	can	spare	one	or	two	for	a	couple	of	hours.	I
can	give	you	the	windows	for	each	one	when	they’l	be	at	the	right	angle	for	Ares
3	shots-“

“It’s	not	about	satelite	time,	Venk,”	Teddy	interrupted.

Venkat	froze.	“Then…	but…	what…”

Teddy	looked	down.	“We’re	a	public	domain	organization.	There’s	no	such	thing
as	secret	or	secure	information	here.”

“So?”

“Any	imagery	we	take	goes	directly	to	the	public.”

“Again:	so?”

“Mark	Watney’s	body	wil	be	within	a	twenty	meters	of	the	Hab.	Maybe	partialy

buried	in	sand,	but	stil	very	visible,	and	with	a	comm

antenna	sticking	out	of	his	chest.	Any	images	we	take	wil	show	that.”

Venkat	stared.	Then	glared.	“This	is	why	you	denied	my	imagery	requests	for
two	months?”

“Venk,	come	on-“

“Realy,	Teddy?”	he	said.	“You’re	afraid	of	a	PR	problem?”

“The	media’s	obsession	with	Watney’s	death	is	finaly	starting	to	taper	off,”
Teddy	said	evenly.	“It’s	been	bad	press	after	bad	press	for	two	months.	Today’s
memorial	gives	people	closure,	and	the	media	can	move	on	to	some	other	story.
The	last	thing	we	want	to	do	is

dredge	everything	back	up.”

“So	what	do	we	do,	then?	He’s	not	going	to	decompose.	He’l	be	there	forever.”

“Not	forever,”	Teddy	said.	“Within	a	year,	he’l	be	covered	in	sand	from	normal
weather	activity.”

“A	year?”	Venkat	said,	rising	to	his	feet.	“That’s	ludicrous.	We	can’t	wait	a	year
for	this.”

“Why	not?	Ares	5	won’t	even	launch	for	another	five	years.	Plenty	of	time.”

Venkat	took	a	deep	breath	and	thought	for	a	moment.

“Ok,	consider	this,”	he	said.	“Sympathy	for	Watney’s	family	is	realy	high.	Ares
6	could	bring	the	body	back.	We	don’t	say	that’s	the

purpose	of	the	mission,	but	we	make	it	clear	that	would	be	part	of	it.	If	we
framed	it	that	way,	we’d	get	more	support	in	Congress.	But	not	if	we	wait	a	year.
In	a	year,	people	won’t	care	any	more.”

Teddy	rubbed	his	chin.	“Hmm…”

Mindy	stared	at	the	ceiling.	She	had	little	else	to	do.	The	3am	shift	was	pretty
dul.	Only	a	constant	stream	of	coffee	kept	her	awake.

Monitoring	the	status	of	satelites	around	Mars	sounded	like	an	exciting
proposition	when	she	took	the	transfer.	But	the	satelites	tended	to	take	care	of
themselves.	Her	job	turned	out	to	be	sending	emails	as	imagery	became
available.

“Master’s	Degree	in	Mechanical	Engineering,”	she	grumbled	to	herself.	“And
I’m	working	in	an	al-night	photo	booth.”

She	sipped	her	coffee.

A	flicker	on	her	screen	announced	another	set	of	images	were	ready	for	dispatch.
She	checked	the	name	on	the	work	order.	Venkat

Kapoor.

Posting	the	data	directly	to	internal	servers,	she	composed	an	email	to	Dr.
Kapoor.	As	she	entered	the	latitude	and	longitude	of	the

image,	she	recognized	the	numbers.

“31.2°N,	28.5°W…	Acidalia	Planitia…	Ares	3?”

Out	of	curiosity,	she	brought	up	the	first	of	the	17	images.

As	she	suspected,	it	was	the	Ares	3	site.	She’d	heard	they	were	going	to	image	it.
Slightly	ashamed	of	herself,	she	scoured	the	image

for	any	sign	on	Mark	Watney’s	dead	body.	After	a	minute	of	fruitless	searching,
she	was	simultaneously	relieved	and	disappointed.

She	moved	on	to	perusing	the	rest	of	the	image.	The	Hab	was	intact;	Dr.	Kapoor
would	be	happy	to	see	that.

She	brought	the	coffee	mug	to	her	lips,	then	froze.

“Um…”	she	mumbled	to	herself.	“Uhhh…”

Quickly	bringing	up	the	NASA	intranet,	she	navigated	through	the	site	to	the
specifics	of	the	Ares	missions.	After	some	quick	research,

she	picked	up	her	phone.

“Hey,	this	is	Mindy	Park	at	SatCon.	I	need	the	mission	logs	for	Ares	3,	where
can	I	get	‘em?...	Uh	huh…	uh-huh….	Ok…	Thanks.”

After	some	more	time	on	the	intranet,	she	leaned	back	in	her	seat.	She	no	longer
needed	the	coffee	to	keep	awake.

Picking	up	the	phone	again,	“Helo,	Security?	This	is	Mindy	Park	in	SatCon.	I
need	the	emergency	contact	number	for	Dr.	Venkat

Kapoor…	Yes,	the	Director	of	Mars	Missions…	Yes	it’s	and	emergency.”

Mindy	fidgeted	in	her	seat	as	Venkat	trudged	in.

“You	Mindy	Park?”	He	asked,	looking	mildly	annoyed.

“Yeah,”	she	quavered.	“Sorry	to	drag	you	in.”

“I’m	assuming	you	had	a	good	reason.	So?”

“Um,”	she	said,	looking	down.	“Um,	it’s.	Wel.	The	imagery	you	ordered.	Um.
Come	here	and	look.”

He	puled	another	chair	to	her	station	and	seated	himself.	“Is	this	about	Watney’s
body?	Is	that	why	you’re	shook	up?”

“Um,	no,”	she	said.	“Um.	Wel…	uh.”	She	pointed	to	the	screen.

Venkat	inspected	the	image.	“Looks	like	the	Hab’s	in	one	piece.	That’s	good
news.	Solar	array	looks	good.	The	rovers	are	ok,	too.

Main	dish	isn’t	around.	No	surprise	there.	What’s	the	big	emergency?”

“Um,”	she	said,	touching	her	finger	to	the	screen.	“That.”

Venkat	leaned	in	and	looked	closer.	Just	below	the	Hab,	beside	the	rovers,	two
white	circles	sat	in	the	sand.	“Hmm.	Looks	like	Hab

canvas.	Maybe	the	Hab	didn’t	do	wel	after	al?	I	guess	pieces	got	torn	off	and-“

“Um,”	she	interrupted.	“They	look	like	rover	pop-tents.”

Venkat	looked	again.	“Hmm.	Probably	right.”

“How’d	they	get	set	up?”	Mindy	asked.

Venkat	shrugged.	“Commander	Lewis	probably	ordered	them	deployed	during
the	evac.	Not	a	bad	idea.	Have	the	emergency	shelters

ready	in	case	the	MAV	didn’t	work	and	the	Hab	breached.”

“Yeah,	um,”	Mindy	said,	opening	a	document	on	her	computer.	“This	is	the
entire	mission	log	for	Sols	1	through	6.	From	MDV

touchdown	to	MAV	emergency	liftoff.”

“Ok,	and?”

“I	read	through	it.	Several	times.	They	never	threw	out	the	pop	tents.”	Her	voice
cracked	at	the	last	word.

“Wel,	uh…”	Venkat	said,	puzzled.	“They	obviously	did,	but	it	didn’t	make	it	in
to	the	log.”

“They	activated	two	emergency	pop	tents	and	never	told	anyone?”

“Hmm.	That	doesn’t	make	a	lot	of	sense,	no.	Maybe	the	storm	messed	with	the
rovers	and	the	tents	autodeployed.”

“Um,”	Mindy	stammered,	“So	after	autodeploying,	they	detached	themselves
from	the	rovers	and	lined	up	next	to	each	other	20	meters

away?”

Venkat	looked	back	to	the	image.	“Wel	obviously	they	activated	somehow.”

“Why	are	the	solar	cels	clean?”	Mindy	said,	tears	forming.	“There	was	a	huge
sandstorm.	Why	isn’t	there	sand	al	over	them?”

“A	good	wind	could	have	done	it?”	Venkat	said,	unsure.

“Did	I	mention	I	never	found	Watney’s	body?”	She	said,	sniffling.

Venkat’s	eyes	widened	as	he	stared	at	the	picture.	“Oh…”	he	said	quietly.	“Oh
god…”

Mindy	put	her	hands	over	her	face	and	sobbed	quietly.

“Fuck!”	Director	of	Media	Relations	Annie	Montrose	said.	“You	have	got	to	be
fucking	kidding	me!”

Teddy	rubbed	his	forehead.	“How	sure	are	we	of	this?”

“Nearly	100%,”	Venkat	said.

“Fuck!”	Annie	said.

“Not	helping,	Annie,”	Teddy	said.

“Do	you	have	any	idea	the	magnitude	of	shitstorm	this	is	gonna’	be?”	She
retorted.

“One	thing	at	a	time,”	Teddy	said.	“Venk,	what	makes	you	sure	he’s	alive?”

“For	starters,	no	body.”	Venkat	explained.	“Also,	the	pop-tents	are	set	up.	And
the	solar	cels	are	clean.	You	can	thank	Mindy	Park	in

SatCon	for	noticing	al	that,	by	the	way.

“But,”	Venkat	continued,	“his	body	could	have	been	buried	in	the	Sol	6	storm.
The	pop	tents	might	have	autodeployed	and	wind	could

have	blown	them	around.	A	30km/h	windstorm	some	time	later	would	be	strong
enough	to	clean	the	solar	cels	but	not	strong	enough	to

carry	sand.	It’s	not	likely,	but	it’s	possible.

“So	I	spent	the	last	few	hours	checking	everything	I	could.	Commander	Lewis
had	two	outings	in	Rover	2.	The	second	was	on	Sol	5.

According	to	the	logs,	after	returning,	she	plugged	it	in	to	the	Hab	for
recharging.	It	wasn’t	used	again,	and	13	hours	later	they	evac’d.”

He	slid	a	picture	across	the	table	to	Teddy.

“That’s	one	of	the	images	from	last	night.	As	you	can	see,	Rover	2	is	facing
away	from	the	Hab.	The	charging	port	is	in	the	nose,	and	the	cable	isn’t	long
enough	to	reach.”

Teddy	frowned.	“She	must	have	parked	it	facing	the	Hab	or	she	wouldn’t	have
been	able	to	plug	it	in,”	he	said.	“It’s	been	moved	since

Sol	5.”

“Yeah,”	Venkat	said,	sliding	another	picture	to	Teddy.	“But	here’s	the	real
evidence.	In	the	lower	right	of	the	image	you	can	see	the

MDV.	It’s	been	taken	apart.	I’m	pretty	sure	they	wouldn’t	have	done	that	without
teling	us.

“And	the	clincher	is	on	the	right	of	the	image,”	Venkat	pointed.	“The	landing
struts	of	the	MAV.	Looks	like	the	fuel	plant	has	been

completely	removed,	with	considerable	damage	to	the	struts	in	the	process.
There’s	just	no	way	that	could	have	happened	before	liftoff.	It	would	endanger
the	MAV	way	too	much	for	Lewis	to	alow	it.”

“Hey,”	Annie	interrupted.	“Why	not	talk	to	Lewis?	Let’s	go	to	CAPCOM	and
ask	her	this	shit	directly.”

Venkat	looked	to	Teddy	knowingly.	After	a	few	moments,	Teddy	sighed.

“Because,”	he	said.	“If	Watney	realy	is	alive,	we	don’t	want	the	Ares	3	crew	to
know.”

“What!?”	Annie	said.	“How	can	you	not	tel	them?”

“They	have	another	ten	months	on	their	trip	home,”	Teddy	explained.	“Space
travel	is	dangerous.	They	need	to	be	alert	and

undistracted.	They’re	sad	that	they	lost	a	crewmate,	but	they’d	be	devastated	if
they	found	out	they’d	abandoned	him	alive.”

Annie	looked	to	Venkat.	“You’re	on	board	with	this?”

“It’s	a	no-brainer,”	Venkat	said.	“Let	‘em	deal	with	that	emotional	trauma	when
they’re	not	flying	a	spaceship	around.”

“This’l	be	the	most	talked-about	event	since	Apolo	11,”	Annie	said.	“How	wil
you	keep	it	from	them?”

Teddy	shrugged.	“Easy.	We	control	al	communication	with	them.”

“Fuck,”	Annie	said,	opening	her	laptop.	“When	do	you	want	to	go	public?”

“What’s	your	take,”	he	asked.

“Mmm,”	Annie	said,	“We	can	hold	the	pics	for	24	hours	before	we’re	required	to
make	them	public.	We’l	need	to	release	a	statement

along	with	them.	We	don’t	want	people	working	it	out	on	their	own.	We’d	look
like	assholes.”

“Ok,”	Teddy	agreed,	“put	together	a	statement.”

“This	is	so	fucked	up,”	she	said.

“Where	do	we	go	from	here?”	Teddy	asked	Venkat.

“Step	one	is	communication,”	Venkat	said.	“From	the	pics,	it’s	clear	the	comm
array	is	ruined.	We	need	another	way	to	talk.	Once	we

can	talk,	we	can	assess	and	make	plans.”

“Al	right,”	Teddy	said.	“Get	on	it.	Take	anyone	you	want	for	any	department.
Use	as	much	overtime	as	you	want.	Find	a	way	to	talk

to	him.	That’s	your	only	job	right	now.”

“Got	it.”

“Annie,	make	sure	nobody	gets	wind	of	this	til	we	announce.”

“Right,”	Annie	said.	“Who	else	knows?”

“Just	the	three	of	us	and	Mindy	Park	in	SatCon,”	Venkat	said.

“I’l	have	a	word	with	her,”	Annie	said.

Teddy	stood	and	opened	his	cel	phone.	“I’m	going	to	Chicago.	I’l	be	back	later
today.”

“Why?”	Annie	asked.

“That’s	where	Watney’s	parents	live,”	Teddy	said.	“I	owe	them	a	personal
explanation	before	it	breaks	on	the	news.”

“They’l	be	happy	to	hear	their	son’s	alive,”	Annie	said.

“Yeah,	he’s	alive,”	Teddy	said.	“But	if	my	math	is	right,	he’s	doomed	to	starve	to
death	before	we	can	possibly	help	him.	I’m	not

looking	forward	to	the	conversation.”

“Fuck,”	Annie	said,	thoughtfuly.

“Nothing?	Nothing	at	al?”	Venkat	groaned.	“Are	you	kidding	me?	You	had	20
experts	working	for	12	hours	on	this.	We	have	a	multi-

bilion	dolar	communication	network.	You	can’t	figure	out	any	way	to	talk	to
him?”

The	two	men	in	Venkat’s	office	fidgeted	in	their	chairs.

“He’s	got	no	radio,”	said	Chuck.

“Actualy,”	said	Morris,	“He’s	got	a	radio,	but	he	doesn’t	have	a	dish.”

“Thing	is,”	Chuck	continued,	“without	the	dish,	a	signal	would	have	to	be	realy
strong-“

“Like,	melting-the-pigeons	strong-“	Morris	supplied.

“-for	him	to	get	it.”	Chuck	finished.

“We	considered	Martian	satelites,”	Morris	said.	“They’re	way	closer.	But	the
math	doesn’t	work	out.	Even	SuperSurveyor	3,	which

has	the	strongest	transmitter,	would	need	to	be	14	times	more	powerful-“

“17	times,”	Chuck	said.

“14	times,”	Morris	asserted.

“No	it’s	17.	You	forgot	the	amperage	minimum	for	the	heaters	to	keep	the-“

“Guys,”	Venkat	interrupted.	“I	get	the	idea.”

“Sorry.”

“Sorry.”

“Sorry	if	I’m	grumpy,”	Venkat	said.	“I	got	like	2	hours	sleep	last	night.”

“No	problem,”	Morris	said.

“Totaly	understandable,”	Chuck	said.

“Ok,”	Venkat	said.	“Explain	to	me	how	a	single	windstorm	removed	our	ability
to	talk	to	Ares	3.”

“Failure	of	imagination,”	Chuck	said.

“Totaly	didn’t	see	it	coming,”	Morris	agreed.

“How	many	back-up	communication	systems	does	an	Ares	mission	have?”
Venkat	asked.

“Four,”	Chuck	said.

“Three,”	Morris	said.

“No,	it’s	four,”	Chuck	corrected.

“He	said	back-up	systems,”	Morris	insisted.	“That	means	not	including	the
primary	system.”

“Oh	right.	Three.”

“So	four	systems	total,	then,”	Venkat	said.	“Explain	how	we	lost	al	four.”

“Wel,”	Chuck	said,	“The	primary	ran	through	the	big	satelite	dish.	It	blew	away
in	the	storm.	The	rest	of	the	backups	were	the	MAV.”

“Yup,”	Morris	agreed.	“The	MAV	is,	like,	a	communicating	machine.	It	can	talk
to	Earth,	Hermes,	even	satelites	around	Mars	if	it	has	to.	And	it	has	three
independent	systems	to	make	sure	nothing	short	of	a	meteor	strike	can	stop
communication.”

“Problem	is,”	Chuck	said.	“Commander	Lewis	and	the	rest	of	them	took	the
MAV	when	they	left.”

“So	four	independent	communication	systems	became	one.	And	that	one	broke,”
Morris	finished.

Venkat	pinched	the	bridge	of	his	nose.	“How	could	we	overlook	this?”

Chuck	shrugged.	“Never	occurred	to	us.	We	never	thought	someone	would	be	on
Mars	without	an	MAV.”

“I	mean,	come	on!”	Morris	said.	“What	are	the	odds?”

Chuck	turned	to	him.	“One	in	three,	based	on	empirical	data.	That’s	pretty	bad	if
you	think	about	it.”

“Thank	you	al	for	coming	on	such	short	notice,”	Annie	said.	“We	have	an
important	announcement	to	make.	If	you	could	al	take	your

seats,”

“What	this	about,	Annie?”	A	reporter	asked.	“Something	happen	with	Hermes?”

“Please	take	your	seats,”	Annie	repeated.

The	reporters	mingled	a	bit,	argued	over	seats	for	a	short	time,	then	finaly	settled
down.

“This	is	a	short,	but	very	important	announcement,”	Annie	said.	“I	won’t	be
taking	any	questions	at	this	time,	but	we	wil	have	a	ful

press	conference	with	Q&A	in	about	an	hour.	We	have	recently	reviewed	satelite
imagery	from	Mars,	and	have	confirmed	that	astronaut

Mark	Watney	is,	currently,	stil	alive.”

After	one	ful	second	of	utter	silence,	the	room	exploded	with	noise.

“I’m	getting	sick	of	daily	press	conferences,”	Venkat	said.

“I’m	getting	sick	of	hourly	press	conferences,”	Annie	countered.

“Sorry	I’m	late,”	Teddy	said,	entering	the	crowded	press	room.	Managers	from
every	department	stood	shoulder	to	shoulder	in	the

back,	while	reporters	crammed	the	pit.

Teddy	puled	some	flash	cards	from	his	pocket,	then	cleared	his	throat.

“In	the	nine	days	since	announcing	Mark	Watney’s	survival,	we’re	received	a
massive	show	of	support	from	al	sectors.	We’re	using

this	shamelessly	every	way	we	can.”

A	smal	chuckle	cascaded	through	the	room.

“Yesterday,	at	our	request,	the	entire	SETI	network	focused	on	Mars.	Just	in	case
Watney	was	sending	a	weak	radio	signal.	Turns	out

he	wasn’t,	but	it	shows	the	level	of	commitment	everyone	has	toward	helping	us.

“The	public	is	engaged,	and	we	wil	do	our	best	to	keep	everyone	informed.	I’ve
recently	learned	CNN	wil	be	dedicating	a	half-hour

segment	every	weekday	to	reporting	on	just	this	issue.	We	wil	assign	several
members	of	our	Media	Relations	team	to	that	program,	so	the	public	can	get	the
latest	information	as	fast	as	possible.

“We	have	adjusted	the	orbits	of	three	satelites	to	get	more	view	time	on	the	Ares
3	site,	and	hope	to	catch	an	image	of	him	outside

soon.	If	we	can	see	him	outside,	we	wil	be	able	to	draw	conclusions	on	his

physical	health	based	on	stance	and	activities.

“The	questions	are	many:	How	long	can	he	last?	How	much	food	does	he	have?
Can	Ares	4	rescue	him?	How	wil	we	talk	to	him?	The

answers	to	these	questions	are	not	what	we	want	to	hear.

“I	can’t	promise	we’l	succeed	in	rescuing	him,	but	I	can	promise	this:	The	entire
focus	of	NASA	wil	be	to	bring	Mark	Watney	home.

This	wil	be	our	overriding	and	singular	obsession	until	he	is	either	back	on
Earth,	or	confirmed	dead	on	Mars.”

“Nice	speech,”	Venkat	said	as	he	entered	Teddy’s	office.

“Meant	every	word	of	it,”	Teddy	said.

“Oh,	I	know.”

“What	can	I	do	for	you,	Venk?”

“I’ve	got	an	idea.	Wel,	JPL	has	an	idea.	I’m	the	messenger.”

“I	like	ideas,”	Teddy	said,	gesturing	to	a	seat.

Venkat	sat	down.

“We	can	rescue	him	with	Ares	4.	It’s	very	risky.	We	ran	the	idea	by	the	Ares	4
crew.	Not	only	are	they	wiling	to	do	it,	but	now

they’re	realy	pushing	hard	for	it.”

“Naturaly,”	Teddy	said.	“Astronauts	are	inherently	insane.	And	realy	noble.
What’s	the	idea?”

“Wel,”	Venkat	began,	“It’s	in	the	rough	stages,	but	JPL	thinks	the	MDV	can	be
misused	to	save	him.”

“Ares	4	hasn’t	even	launched	yet.	Why	misuse	an	MDV.	Why	not	make
something	better?”

“We	don’t	have	time	to	make	a	custom	craft.	Actualy,	he	can’t	even	survive	til
Ares	4	gets	there,	but	that’s	a	different	problem.”

“So	tel	me	about	the	MDV.”

“JPL	strips	it	down,	loses	some	weight,	and	adds	some	fuel	tanks.	Ares	4’s	crew
lands	at	the	Ares	3	site,	very	efficiently.	Then,	with	a	ful	burn,	and	I	mean	a	full
burn,	they	can	lift	off	again.	It	can’t	get	back	to	orbit,	but	it	can	go	to	the	Ares	4
site	on	a	lateral	trajectory	that’s,	wel,	realy	scary.	Then	they	have	an	MAV.	This
would	require	a	massive	design	and	construction	effort,	but	JPL	says	they	can

make	it	happen.”

“How	are	they	losing	weight?”	Teddy	asked.	“Don’t	they	already	have	it	as	light
as	it	can	be?”

“By	removing	safety	and	emergency	equipment.”

“Wonderful,”	Teddy	said,	“So	we’d	be	risking	the	lives	of	six	more	people	in	a
very	dangerous	landing,	re-liftoff,	re-landing	process.”

“Yup,”	Venkat	said.	“It	would	be	safer	to	leave	the	Ares	4	crew	in	Hermes,	and
only	send	the	pilot	down	with	the	MDV.	But	that

would	mean	giving	up	the	mission	and	they’d	rather	risk	death.”

“They’re	astronauts,”	Teddy	said.

“They’re	astronauts,”	Venkat	confirmed.

“Wel.	That’s	a	ludicrous	idea	and	I’l	never	ok	it.”

“We’l	work	on	it	some	more,”	Venkat	said.	“Try	to	make	it	safer.”

“Do	that.	Any	idea	how	to	keep	him	alive	for	four	years?”

“Nope.”

“Work	on	that,	too.”

“Wil	do,”	Venkat	said.

Teddy	swiveled	his	chair	and	looked	out	the	window	to	the	sky	beyond.	Night
was	edging	in.	“What	must	it	be	like?”	He	pondered.

“He’s	stuck	out	there.	He	thinks	he’s	totaly	alone	and	that	we	al	gave	up	on	him.
What	kind	of	effect	does	that	have	on	a	man’s

psychology?”

He	turned	back	to	Venkat.	“I	wonder	what	he’s	thinking	right	now.”

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	63

I	finished	making	water	some	time	ago.	I’m	no	longer	in	danger	of	blowing
myself	up.	The	potatoes	are	growing	nicely.	Nothing	has

conspired	to	kil	me	in	weeks.	And	‘70’s	TV	keeps	me	disturbingly	more
entertained	than	it	should.	Things	are	stable	here	on	Mars.

It’s	time	to	start	thinking	long	term.

Even	if	I	find	a	way	to	tel	NASA	I’m	alive,	there’s	no	guarantee	they’l	be	able	to
save	me.	I	need	to	be	proactive.	I	need	to	figure	out	how	to	get	to	Ares	4.

Won’t	be	easy.

Ares	4	wil	be	landing	at	the	Schiapareli	Crater,	3,200km	away.	In	fact,	their
MAV	is	already	there.	I	know	because	I	watched

Martinez	land	it.

It	takes	18	months	for	the	MAV	to	make	its	fuel,	so	it’s	the	first	thing	NASA
sends	along.	Sending	it	48	months	early	gives	it	plenty	of	extra	time	in	case	fuel
reactions	go	slower	than	expected.	But	much	more	importantly,	it	means	a
precision	soft-landing	can	be	done

remotely	by	a	pilot	in	orbit.	Direct	remote	operation	from	Houston	isn’t	an
option;	they’re	anywhere	from	4	to	20	light-minutes	away.

Ares	4’s	MAV	spent	11	months	getting	to	Mars.	Using	less	fuel	and	taking	a
longer	route,	it	got	there	around	the	same	time	as	us.	As

expected,	Martinez	landed	it	beautifuly.	It	was	one	of	the	last	things	we	did
before	piling	in	to	our	MDV	and	heading	to	the	surface.	Ahh,	the	good	old	days,
when	I	had	a	crew	with	me.

I’m	lucky.	3,200km	isn’t	that	bad.	It	could	have	been	up	to	10,000km	away.	And

because	I’m	on	the	flattest	part	of	Mars,	the	first

650km	is	nice,	smooth	terrain	(Yay	Acidalia	Planitia!)	but	the	rest	of	it	is	nasty,
rugged,	crater-pocked	hel.

Obviously,	I’l	have	to	use	a	rover.	And	guess	what?	They	weren’t	designed	for
massive	overland	journeys.

This	is	going	to	be	a	research	effort,	with	a	bunch	of	experimentation.	I’l	have	to
become	my	own	little	NASA,	figuring	out	how	to

explore	far	from	the	Hab.	The	good	news	is	I	have	lots	of	time	to	figure	it	out.
Almost	4	years.

Some	stuff	is	obvious.	I’l	need	to	use	a	rover.	It’l	take	a	long	time,	so	I’l	need	to
bring	supplies.	I’l	need	to	recharge	en-route,	and	rovers	don’t	have	solar	cels.	I’l
need	to	steal	some	from	the	Hab’s	solar	farm.	During	the	trip	I’l	need	to	breathe,
eat,	and	drink.

Lucky	for	me,	the	tech	specs	for	everything	are	right	here	in	the	computer.

I’l	need	to	trick	out	a	rover.	Basicaly	it’l	have	to	be	a	mobile	Hab.	I’l	pick	Rover
2	as	my	target.	We	have	a	certain	bond,	after	I

spent	two	days	in	it	during	the	“Great	Hydrogen	Scare	of	Sol	37.”

There’s	too	much	shit	to	think	about	al	at	once.	So	for	now,	I’l	just	think	about
power.

Our	mission	had	a	10km	operational	radius.	Knowing	we	wouldn’t	take	straight-
line	paths,	NASA	designed	the	rovers	to	go	35km	on

a	ful	charge.	That	presumes	flat,	reasonable	terrain.	Each	rover	has	a	9000Wh
battery.

Step	one	is	to	loot	Rover	1’s	battery	and	instal	it	in	Rover	2.	Ta-daa!	I	just
doubled	my	ful-charge	range.

There’s	just	one	complication.	Heating.

Part	of	the	battery	power	goes	to	heating	the	rover.	Mars	is	realy	cold.	Normaly,
we	were	expected	to	do	al	EVAs	in	under	5	hours.

But	I’l	be	living	in	it	24½	hours	a	day.	According	to	the	specs,	the	heating
equipment	soaks	up	400W.	Keeping	it	on	would	eat	up

9800Wh	per	day.	Over	half	my	power	supply,	every	day!

But	I	do	have	a	free	source	of	heat:	Me.	A	couple	milion	years	of	evolution	gave
me	“warm	blooded”	technology.	I	can	wear	layers.

The	rover	has	good	insulation,	too.	It’l	have	to	be	enough;	I	need	every	bit	of
power.

And	because	I	need	to	bundle	up	anyway,	I	can	deactivate	the	heater	outright	and
use	all	the	power	for	motion	(minus	a	negligible	amount	for	computer,	life
support,	etc.)

According	to	my	boring	math,	moving	the	rover	eats	200Wh	of	juice	to	go	1km,
so	using	the	ful	18,000Wh	gets	me	90km	of	travel.

Now	we’re	talkin’.

I’l	never	actually	get	90km	on	a	single	charge.	I’l	have	hils	to	deal	with,	and
rough	terrain,	sand,	etc.	But	it’s	a	good	balpark.	It	tels	me	that	it	would	take	at
least	35	days	of	travel	to	get	to	Ares	4.	It’l	probably	be	more	like	50.	But	that’s
plausible,	at	least.

At	the	rover’s	blazing	25kph	top	speed,	it’l	take	me	3½	hours	before	I	run	the
battery	down.	I’d	like	to	charge	the	battery	up	during

the	rest	of	the	day.	I	can	drive	in	twilight,	and	save	the	sunny	part	of	the	day	for
charging.	This	time	of	year	I	get	about	13	hours	of	light.

How	many	solar	cels	wil	I	have	to	pilfer	from	the	Hab’s	farm?

Thanks	to	the	fine	taxpayers	of	America,	I	have	over	100	of	square	meters	of	the
most	expensive	solar	paneling	ever	made.	It	has	an

astounding	10.2%	efficiency,	which	is	good	because	Mars	doesn’t	get	as	much

sunlight	as	Earth.	Only	500	to	700	watts	per	square	meter

(Compared	to	the	1400	those	spoiled	Earthlings	get).

Long	story	short:	I	need	to	bring	28	square	meters	of	solar	cel.	That’s	14	panels.

I	can	put	two	stacks	of	7	on	the	roof.	They’l	stick	out	over	the	edges,	but	as	long
as	they’re	secure	I’m	happy.	Every	day,	after

driving,	I’l	spread	them	out	then…	wait	al	day.	Man	it’l	be	dul.

Wel	it’s	a	start.	Tomorrow’s	mission:	transfer	Rover	1’s	battery	to	Rover	2.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	64

Sometimes	things	are	easy,	and	sometimes	they’re	not.	Getting	the	battery	out	of
Rover	1	was	easy.	I	removed	two	clamps	on	the

undercarriage	and	it	dropped	right	out.	The	cabling	is	easy	to	detach,	too.	It’s
just	a	couple	of	complicated	plugs.

Attaching	it	to	Rover	2,	however,	is	another	story.	There’s	nowhere	to	put	it!

The	things	is	huge.	I	was	barely	able	to	drag	it.	And	that’s	in	Mars	gravity.

It’s	just	too	big.	There’s	no	room	in	the	undercarriage	for	a	second	one.	There’s
no	room	on	the	roof,	either.	That’s	where	the	solar

cels	wil	go.	There’s	no	room	inside	the	cabin,	and	it	wouldn’t	fit	through	the
airlock	anyway.

But	fear	not,	I	found	a	solution.

For	emergencies	completely	unrelated	to	this	one,	NASA	provided	6	square
meters	of	Hab	canvas,	and	some	realy	impressive	resin.

The	same	kind	of	resin,	in	fact,	that	saved	my	life	on	Sol	6	(the	patch	kit	I	used
on	the	hole	in	my	suit).

In	the	event	of	a	Hab	breach,	everyone	would	run	to	the	airlocks.	Procedure	was
to	let	it	pop	rather	than	die	trying	to	prevent	it.	Then,	we’d	suit	up	and	assess	the

damage.	Once	we	found	the	breach,	we’d	seal	it	with	the	spare	Hab	canvas	and
resin.	Then	re-inflate	and

we’re	good	as	new.

The	6	square	meters	of	spare	canvas	was	a	convenient	1x6	meters.	I	cut	10cm
wide	strips,	then	used	them	to	make	a	sort	of	harness.

I	used	the	resin	and	straps	to	make	two	10m	circumference	loops.	Then	I	put	a
big	patch	of	canvas	on	each	end.	I	now	had	poor-

man’s	saddlebags	for	my	rover.

This	is	getting	more	and	more	“Wagon	Train”	every	day.

The	resin	sets	almost	instantly.	But	it	gets	stronger	if	you	wait	an	hour.	So	I	did.
Then	I	suited	up	and	headed	out	to	the	rover.

I	dragged	the	battery	to	the	side	of	the	rover	and	looped	one	end	of	the	harness
around	it.	Then	I	threw	the	other	end	over	the	roof.	On	the	other	side,	I	filed	it
with	rocks.	When	the	two	weights	were	roughly	equal,	I	was	able	to	pul	the
rocks	down	and	bring	the	battery	up.

Yay!

Unplugging	Rover	2’s	battery,	I	plugged	in	Rover	1’s.	Then	I	went	through	the
airlock	to	the	rover	and	checked	al	systems.	Everything

was	a-ok.

I	drove	the	rover	around	a	bit	to	make	sure	the	harness	was	secure.	I	found	a	few
large-ish	rocks	to	drive	over,	just	to	shake	things	up.

The	harness	held.	Hel	yeah.

For	a	short	time,	I	wondered	how	to	splice	the	second	battery’s	leads	into	the
main	power	supply.	My	conclusion	was	“Fuck	it.”

There’s	no	need	to	have	a	continuous	power	supply.	When	Battery	1	runs	out,	I
can	get	out,	unplug	Battery	1	and	plug	in	Battery	2.

Why	not?	It’s	a	10	minute	EVA,	once	per	day.	I’d	have	to	swap	batteries	again
when	charging,	but	again:	so	what?

I	spent	the	rest	of	the	day	sweeping	off	the	solar	cel	farm.	Soon,	I	shal	be	looting
it.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	65

The	solar	cels	were	a	lot	easier	to	manage	than	the	battery.

They’re	thin,	light,	and	just	laying	around	on	the	ground.	And	I	had	one
additional	bonus:	I	was	the	one	who	set	them	up	In	the	first

place.

Wel,	ok.	It	wasn’t	just	me.	Vogel	and	I	worked	together	on	it.	And	boy	did	we
dril	on	it.	We	spent	almost	an	entire	week	driling	on	the	solar	array	alone.	Then
we	driled	more	whenever	they	figured	we	had	spare	time.	It	had	been	deemed
mission	critical.	If	we	fucked	it	up	and	broke	the	cels	or	rendered	them	useless,
the	Hab	wouldn’t	be	able	to	make	power,	and	the	mission	would	end.

You	might	wonder	what	the	rest	of	the	crew	were	doing.	They	were	setting	up
the	Hab.	Remember,	everything	in	my	glorious	kingdom

came	here	in	boxes.	We	had	to	set	it	up	on	Sols	1	and	2.

Each	solar	cel	is	on	a	lightweight	lattice	that	holds	it	at	a	14	degree	angle.	I’l
admit	I	don’t	know	why	it’s	a	14	degree	angle.	Something	about	maximizing
solar	energy.	Anyway,	removing	the	cels	was	simple.	Then	it	was	time	to	stack
them	on	the	rover.

I	considered	removing	the	rock	sample	container.	It’s	nothing	more	than	a	large
canvas	bag	attached	to	the	roof.	Way	too	smal	to	hold

the	solar	cels.	But	after	some	thought	I	left	it	there,	figuring	It’l	provide	a	good
cushion.

The	cels	stacked	wel	(they	were	made	to,	for	transport	to	Mars),	and	the	two
stacks	sat	nicely	on	the	roof.	They	hung	over	the	left

and	right	edges,	but	I	won’t	be	going	through	any	tunnels	so	I	don’t	care.

With	some	more	abuse	of	the	emergency	Hab	material,	I	made	straps	and	tied
the	cels	down.	The	rover	has	external	handles	near	the

front	and	back.	They’re	there	to	help	us	load	rocks	on	the	roof.	They	made
perfect	anchor	points	for	the	straps.

I	stood	back	and	admired	my	work.	Hey,	I	earned	it.	It	wasn’t	even	noon	and	I
was	done.

I	came	back	to	the	Hab,	had	some	lunch,	and	worked	on	my	crops	for	the	rest	of
the	sol.	It's	been	39	sols	since	I	planted	the	potatoes

(which	is	about	40	Earth	days),	and	it	was	time	to	reap	and	re-sow.

They	grew	even	better	than	I	had	expected.	Mars	has	no	insects,	parasites,	or
blights	to	deal	with,	and	the	Hab	maintains	perfect

growing	temperature	and	moisture	at	al	times.

They	were	smal	compared	to	the	taters	you'd	usualy	eat,	but	that's	fine.	Al	I
wanted	was	enough	to	support	growing	new	plants.

I	dug	them	up,	being	careful	to	leave	their	plants	alive.	Then	I	cut	them	up	in	to
smal	pieces	with	one	eye	each,	and	re-seeded	in	to	new	dirt.	If	they	keep
growing	this	wel,	I'l	be	able	to	last	a	good	long	time	here.

After	al	that	physical	labor,	I	deserved	a	break.	I	rifled	through	Johanssen’s
computer	today,	and	found	an	endless	supply	of	digital

books.	Looks	like	she’s	a	big	fan	of	Agatha	Christie.	Beatles,	Christie…	I	guess
Johanssen’s	an	anglophile	or	something.

I	remember	liking	Hercule	Poirot	TV	specials	back	when	I	was	a	kid.	I’l	start
with	The	Mysterious	Affair	at	Styles.	Looks	like	that’s	the	first	one.

NASA	gets	to	name	their	missions	after	gods	and	stuff,	so	why	can’t	I?

I	won’t	be	an	idiot.	I’m	not	driving	directly	away	from	the	Hab.	I’l	drive	a	half-

Tonight,	I’l	charge	up	both	batteries	so	I	can	be	ready	for	a	little	test	drive

And,	with	the	heater	off,	I’l	wear	three	layers	of	clothes.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	67

Sirius	1	is	complete!

More	accurately,	Sirius	1	was	aborted	after	1	hour.	I	guess	you	could	cal	it	a
“failure”	but	I	prefer	the	term	“learning	experience.”

Things	started	out	fine.	I	drove	to	a	nice	flat	spot	a	kilometer	from	the	Hab,	then
started	going	back	and	forth	over	a	500m	stretch.

I	quickly	realized	this	would	be	a	crappy	test.	After	a	few	laps,	I	had	compressed
the	soil	enough	to	have	a	solid	path.	Nice,	hard

ground,	which	makes	for	abnormaly	high	energy	efficiency.	This	is	nothing	like
it	would	be	on	a	long	trip.

So	I	shook	it	up	a	bit.	I	drove	around	randomly,	making	sure	to	stay	within	a
kilometer	of	the	Hab.	A	much	more	realistic	test.

After	an	hour,	things	started	to	get	cold.	And	I	mean	really	cold.

The	rover’s	always	cold	when	you	first	get	in	it.	When	you	haven’t	disabled	the
heater	it	warms	up	right	away.	I	expected	it	to	be	cold,	but	Jesus	Christ!

I	was	fine	for	a	while.	My	own	body	heat	plus	three	layers	of	clothing	kept	me
warm	and	the	rover’s	insulation	is	top-notch.	The	heat

that	escaped	my	body	just	warmed	up	the	interior.	But	there’s	no	such	thing	as
perfect	insulation,	and	eventualy	the	heat	left	to	the	great	outdoors	while	I	got
colder	and	colder.

Within	an	hour,	I	was	chattering	and	numb.	Enough	was	enough.	There’s	no	way
I	could	do	a	long	trip	like	this.	The	test	was	over.

Turning	the	heater	on,	I	drove	straight	back	to	the	Hab.

Once	I	got	home,	I	sulked	for	a	while.	Al	my	briliant	plans	foiled	by
thermodynamics.	Damn	you,	Entropy!

I’m	in	a	bind.	The	damn	heater	wil	eat	half	my	battery	power	every	day.	I	could
turn	it	down,	I	guess.	Be	a	little	cold	but	not	freezing	to	death.	Even	then	I’d	stil
lose	at	least	a	quarter.

This	wil	require	some	thought.	I	have	to	ask	myself…	what	would	Hercule
Poirot	do?	I’l	have	to	put	my	“little	gray	cels”	to	work	on

the	problem.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	68

Wel	shit.

I	came	up	with	a	solution,	but…	remember	when	I	burned	rocket	fuel	in	the
Hab?	This’l	be	more	dangerous.

I’m	going	to	use	the	RTG.

The	RTG	(Radioisotope	Thermoelectric	Generator)	is	a	big	box	of	Plutonium.
But	not	the	kind	used	in	nuclear	bombs.	No,	no.	This

Plutonium	is	way	more	dangerous!

Plutonium-238	is	an	incredibly	unstable	isotope.	It’s	so	radioactive	that	it	wil	get
red	hot	al	by	itself.	As	you	can	imagine,	a	material	that	can	literally	fry	an	egg

with	radiation	is	kind	of	dangerous.

The	RTG	houses	the	Plutonium,	catches	the	radiation	in	the	form	of	heat,	and
turns	it	in	to	electricity.	It’s	not	a	reactor.	The	radiation	can’t	be	increased	or
decreased.	It’s	a	purely	natural	process	happening	at	the	atomic	level.

As	long	ago	as	the	1960’s,	NASA’s	been	using	RTGs	to	power	unmanned
probes.	It	has	lots	of	advantages	over	solar	power.	It’s	not

affected	by	storms;	it	works	day	or	night;	it’s	entirely	internal,	so	you	don’t	need
delicate	solar	cels	al	over	your	probe.

But	they	never	used	large	RTGs	on	manned	missions	until	The	Ares	Program.

Why	not?	It	should	be	pretty	fucking	obvious	why	not!	They	didn’t	want	to	put
astronauts	next	to	a	glowing	hot	bal	of	radioactive

death!

I'm	exaggerating	a	little.	The	Plutonium	is	inside	a	bunch	of	pelets,	each	one
sealed	and	insulated	to	prevent	radiation	leakage	even	if	the	outer	container	is
breached.	So	for	the	Ares	Program,	they	took	the	risk.

An	Ares	mission	is	al	about	the	MAV.	It’s	the	single	most	important	component.
It’s	one	of	the	few	systems	that	can’t	be	replaced	or

worked	around.	It’s	the	only	component	that	causes	a	complete	mission	scrub	if
it’s	not	working.

Solar	cels	are	great	in	the	short-term,	and	they’re	good	for	the	long-term	if	you
have	humans	around	to	clean	them.	But	the	MAV	sits

alone	for	years	quietly	making	fuel,	then	just	kind	of	hangs	out	until	its	crew
arrives.	Even	doing	nothing,	it	needs	power,	so	NASA	can	monitor	it	remotely
and	run	self	checks.

The	prospect	of	scrubbing	a	mission	because	a	solar	cel	got	dirty	was
unacceptable.	They	needed	a	more	reliable	source	of	power.	So

the	MAV	comes	equipped	with	an	RTG.	It	has	2.6kg	of	Plutonium-238,	which

makes	almost	1500	Watts	of	heat.	It	can	turn	that	in	to	100

Watts	of	electricity.	The	MAV	runs	on	that	until	the	crew	arrive.

100	Watts	isn’t	enough	to	keep	the	heater	going,	but	I	don’t	care	about	the
electrical	output.	I	want	the	heat.	A	1500	Watt	heater	is	so	warm	I’l	have	to	tear
insulation	out	of	the	rover	to	keep	it	from	getting	too	hot.

As	soon	as	the	rovers	were	un-stowed	and	activated,	Commander	Lewis	had	the
joy	of	disposing	of	the	RTG.	She	detached	it	from

the	MAV,	drove	4	km	away,	and	buried	it.	However	safe	it	may	be,	it's	stil	a
radioactive	core	and	NASA	didn't	want	it	too	close	to	their	astronauts.

The	mission	parameters	don’t	give	a	specific	location	to	dump	the	RTG.	Just	“At
least	4km	away”.	So	I’l	have	to	find	it.

I	have	two	things	working	for	me.	First,	I	was	assembling	solar	panels	with
Vogel	when	Commander	Lewis	drove	off,	and	I	saw	she

headed	due	south.	Also,	she	planted	a	3	meter	pole	with	a	bright	green	flag	on	it
where	she	buried	it.	Green	shows	up	extremely	wel

against	the	Martian	terrain.	It’s	made	to	ward	us	off,	in	case	we	get	lost	on	a
rover	EVA	later	on.

So	my	plan	is:	Head	south	4km,	then	search	around	til	I	see	the	green	flag.

Having	rendered	Rover	1	unusable,	I’l	have	to	use	my	Mutant	Rover	for	the	trip.
I	can	make	a	useful	test	mission	of	it.	I’l	see	how	wel

the	battery	harness	holds	up	to	a	real	journey,	and	how	wel	the	solar	cels	do
strapped	to	the	roof.

I’l	cal	it	Sirius	2.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	69

Found	the	RTG.

It	wasn’t	hard	to	find.	I	drove	4km	south	and	saw	the	flag	right	away.

Commander	Lewis	had	buried	it	atop	a	smal	hil.	She	probably	wanted	to	make
sure	everyone	could	see	the	flag,	and	it	worked	great!

Except	instead	of	avoiding	it,	I	bee-lined	to	it	and	dug	it	up.	Not	exactly	what
she	was	going	for.

It’s	a	large	cylinder	with	heat-sinks	al	around	it.	I	could	feel	the	warmth	it	gave
off	even	through	my	suit’s	gloves.	That’s	realy

disconcerting.	Especialy	when	you	know	the	root	cause	of	the	heat	is	radiation.

No	point	in	putting	it	on	the	roof;	my	plan	was	to	have	it	in	the	cabin	anyway.	So
I	brought	it	in	with	me,	turned	off	the	heater,	then

drove	back	to	the	Hab.

In	the	10	minutes	it	took	to	get	home,	even	with	the	heater	off,	the	interior	of	the
rover	became	an	uncomfortably	hot	37C.	The	RTG

would	definitely	be	able	to	keep	me	warm.

The	trip	also	proved	my	rigging	worked.	The	solar	cels	and	extra	battery	stayed
beautifuly	in	place	while	traversing	8km	of	random

terrain.

I	declare	Sirius	2	to	be	a	successful	mission!

I	spent	the	rest	of	the	day	vandalizing	the	interior	of	the	rover.	The	pressure
compartment	is	made	of	metal.	Just	inside	that	is	insulation,	which	is	covered	by
hard	plastic.	I	used	a	sophisticated	method	to	remove	sections	of	plastic
(hammer),	then	carefuly	removed	the	solid

foam	insulation	(hammer	again).

After	tearing	out	some	insulation,	I	suited	up	and	took	the	RTG	outside.	Soon,
the	rover	cooled	down	again,	and	I	brought	it	back	in.	I

watched	as	the	temperature	rose	slowly.	Nowhere	near	as	fast	as	it	had	on	my
trip	back	from	the	burial	site.

I	cautiously	removed	more	insulation	(hammer)	and	checked	again.	After	a	few
more	cycles	of	this,	I	had	enough	insulation	torn	out	that

the	RTG	could	barely	keep	up	with	it.	In	fact,	it	was	a	losing	battle.	Over	time,
heat	would	slowly	leech	out.	That’s	fine.	I	can	turn	on	the	heater	for	short	bursts
when	necessary.

I	brought	the	insulation	pieces	with	me	back	in	to	the	Hab.	Using	advanced
construction	techniques	(duct	tape)	I	reassembled	some	of

it	into	a	square.	I	figure	if	things	got	realy	cold,	I	could	tape	that	to	a	bare	patch
in	the	rover,	and	the	RTG	would	be	winning	the	“heat	fight.”

Tomorrow,	Sirius	3	(Which	is	just	Sirius	1	again,	but	without	freezing)

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	70

Today,	I	write	to	you	from	the	rover.	I’m	halfway-through	Sirius	3	and	things	are
going	wel.

I	set	out	at	first	light	and	drove	laps	around	the	Hab,	trying	to	stay	on	untouched
ground.	The	first	battery	lasted	just	under	two	hours.

After	a	quick	EVA	to	switch	the	cables,	I	got	back	to	driving.	When	al	was	said
and	done,	I	had	driven	81km	in	3	hours	and	27	minutes.

That’s	very	good!	Mind	you,	the	land	around	the	Hab	is	realy	flat,	as	is	al	of
Acidalia	Planitia.	I	have	no	idea	what	my	efficiency	would	be	on	the	nastier	land
en	route	to	Ares	4.

I	could	have	gone	further,	but	I	need	life	support	while	recharging.	The	CO2	gets
absorbed	through	a	chemical	process,	but	if	the	fan

that	pushes	it	isn’t	working,	I’l	choke.	The	oxygen	pump	is	also	kind	of
important.

I	set	up	the	solar	cels.	It	was	hard	work;	last	time	I	had	Vogel’s	help.	They	aren’t
heavy,	but	they’re	awkward.	After	setting	up	half	of	them,	I	figured	out	I	could
drag	them	rather	than	carry	them	and	that	sped	things	up.

Now	I’m	just	waiting	for	the	batteries	to	recharge.	I’m	bored,	so	I’m	updating
the	log.	I	have	al	the	Poirot	books	in	my	computer.

That’l	help.	It’s	going	to	take	12	hours	to	recharge,	after	al.

What’s	that,	you	say?	12	hours	is	wrong?	I	said	13	hours	earlier?	Wel,	my	friend,
let	me	set	you	straight.

The	RTG	is	a	generator.	It’s	a	paltry	amount	of	power,	compared	to	what	the
rover	consumes,	but	it’s	not	nothing.	It’s	100	Watts.

It’l	cut	an	hour	off	my	total	recharge	time.	Why	not	use	it?

I	wonder	what	NASA	would	think	about	me	fucking	with	the	RTG	like	this.
They’d	probably	hide	under	their	desks	and	cuddle	their

slide-rules	for	comfort.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	71

As	predicted,	it	took	12	hours	to	charge	the	batteries	to	ful.	I	came	straight	home.

Time	to	make	plans	for	Sirius	4.	And	I	think	it’l	be	a	multi-day	field	trip.

Looks	like	power	and	battery	recharging	is	solved.	Food’s	not	a	problem;	there’s
plenty	of	space	to	store	things.	Water’s	even	easier

than	food.	I	need	2L	per	day	to	be	comfortable.

In	the	long	term,	I’l	need	to	bring	the	Oxygenator.	But	it’s	big	and	I	don’t	want
to	screw	with	it	right	now.	So	I’l	rely	on	O2	and	CO2

filters	for	Sirius	4.

CO2	isn’t	a	problem.	I	started	this	grand	adventure	with	1500	hours	of	CO2
filters,	plus	another	720	for	emergency	use.	Al	systems

use	standard	filters	(Apolo	13	taught	us	important	lessons).	Since	then,	I’ve	used
131	hours	of	filter	on	various	EVAs.	I	have	2089	left.	87

days	worth.	Plenty.

The	rover	was	designed	to	support	3	people	for	2	days,	plus	some	reserve	for
safety.	So	its	O2	tanks	can	hold	enough	to	last	me	7

days.	Not	enough.

Mars	has	1/90th	Earth’s	atmospheric	pressure.	The	inside	of	the	rover	has	1
atmosphere.	So	the	oxygen	tanks	are	on	the	inside	(less

pressure	differential	to	deal	with).	Why	does	that	matter?	It	means	I	can	bring
along	other	oxygen	tanks,	and	equalize	them	with	the	rover’s	tanks	without
having	to	do	an	EVA.

So	today,	I	detached	one	of	the	Hab’s	two	25L	oxygen	tanks	and	brought	it	in	to
the	rover.	According	to	NASA,	a	human	needs

588L	of	oxygen	per	day	to	live.	Compressed	liquid	O2	is	about	1000	times	as
dense	as	gaseous	O2	in	a	comfortable	atmosphere.	Long

story	short:	with	the	Hab	tank,	I	have	enough	O2	to	last	42	days.	That’l	be
plenty.

Sirius	4	wil	be	a	20	day	trip.

That	may	seem	a	bit	long,	but	I	have	a	specific	goal	in	mind.	Besides,	my	trip	to
Ares	4	wil	be	at	least	40	days.	This	is	a	good	scale

model.

While	I’m	away,	the	Hab	can	take	care	of	itself,	but	the	potatoes	are	an	issue.	I’l
saturate	the	ground	with	most	of	the	water	I	have.

Then,	I’l	deactivate	the	Atmospheric	Regulator,	so	it	doesn’t	pul	water	out	of	the
air.	It’l	be	humid	as	hel,	and	water	wil	condense	on

every	surface.	That’l	keep	the	potatoes	wel	watered	while	I’m	away.

A	bigger	problem	is	CO2.	The	potatoes	need	to	breathe.	I	know	what	you’re
thinking.	“Mark,	old	chap!	YOU	produce	carbon

dioxide!	It’s	al	part	of	the	majestic	circle	of	nature!”

The	problem	is:	Where	wil	I	put	it?	Sure,	I	exhale	CO2	with	every	breath,	but	I
don’t	have	any	way	to	store	it.	I	could	turn	off	the

Oxygenator	and	Atmospheric	Regulator	and	just	fil	the	Hab	with	my	breath	over
time.	But	CO2	is	deadly	to	me.	I	need	to	release	a	bunch

at	once	and	run	away.

Remember	the	MAV	fuel	plant?	It	colects	CO2	from	the	Martian	atmosphere.
My	smal	crops	aren’t	nearly	as	needy	as	me,	so	a	10L

tank	of	compressed	liquid	CO2,	vented	in	to	the	Hab,	wil	be	enough	CO2	to	do
the	trick.	That’l	take	less	than	a	day	to	create.

So	that’s	everything.	Once	I	vent	the	CO2	in	to	the	Hab,	I’l	turn	off	the
Atmospheric	Regulator	and	Oxygenator,	dump	a	ton	of	water

on	the	crops,	and	head	out.

Sirius	4.	A	huge	step	forward	in	my	rover	research.	And	I	can	start	tomorrow.

Chapter	8

“Helo,	and	thank	you	for	joining	us,”	Cathy	said	to	the	camera.	“Today	on
CNN’s	Mark	Watney	Report:	Several	EVAs	over	the	past

few	days…	what	do	they	mean?	What	progress	has	NASA	made	on	a	rescue
option?	And	how	wil	this	affect	the	Ares	4	preparations?

“Joining	us	today	is	Dr.	Venkat	Kapoor,	Director	of	Mars	Missions	for	NASA.
Dr.	Kapoor,	thank	you	for	coming.”

“A	pleasure	to	be	here,	Cathy,”	Venkat	said.

“Dr.	Kapoor,”	Cathy	began,	“Mark	Watney	is	the	most-watched	man	in	the	solar
system,	wouldn’t	you	say?”

Venkat	nodded.	“Certainly	the	most	watched	by	NASA.	We	have	al	12	of	our
Martian	satelites	taking	pictures	whenever	his	site’s	in

view.	The	European	Space	Agency	has	both	of	theirs	doing	the	same.”

“Al	told,	how	often	do	you	get	these	images?”

“Every	few	minutes.	Sometimes	there’s	a	gap,	based	on	the	satelite	orbits.	But
it’s	enough	that	we	can	track	al	his	EVA	activities.”

“Tel	us	about	these	latest	EVAs.”

“Wel,”	Venkat	began,	“It	looks	like	he’s	preparing	Rover	2	for	a	long	trip.	On
Sol	65,	he	took	the	battery	from	the	other	rover	and

attached	it	with	a	homemade	sling.	The	next	day,	he	detached	14	solar	cels	and
stacked	them	on	the	rover’s	roof.”

“And	then	he	took	a	little	drive,	didn’t	he?”	Cathy	prompted.

“Yes	he	did.	Sort	of	aimlessly	for	an	hour,	then	back	to	the	Hab.	He	was
probably	testing	it.	Next	time	we	saw	him	was	two	days	later,

when	he	drove	4km	away,	then	back.	Another	incremental	test,	we	think.	Then,
over	the	past	couple	of	days,	he’s	been	stocking	it	up	with	supplies.”

“Hmm,”	Cathy	said,	“Most	analysts	think	Mark’s	only	hope	of	rescue	is	to	get	to
the	Ares	4	site.	Do	you	think	he’s	come	to	the	same

conclusion?”

“Probably,”	Venkat	said.	“He	doesn’t	know	we’re	watching.	From	his	point	of
view,	Ares	4	is	his	only	hope.”

“Do	you	think	he’s	planning	to	go	soon?	He	seems	to	be	getting	ready	for	a	trip.”

“I	hope	not,”	Venkat	said.	“There’s	nothing	at	the	site	other	than	the	MAV.	None
of	the	other	presupplies.	It	would	be	a	very	long,

very	dangerous	trip,	and	he’d	be	leaving	the	safety	of	the	Hab	behind.”

“Why	would	he	risk	it?”

“Communication,”	Venkat	said.	“Once	he	reaches	the	MAV,	he	could	contact
us.”

“So	that	would	be	a	good	thing,	wouldn’t	it?”

“Communication	would	be	a	great	thing.	But	traversing	3,200km	to	Ares	4	is
incredibly	dangerous.	We’d	rather	he	stayed	put.	If	we	could	talk	to	him,	we’d
certainly	tel	him	that.”

“He	can’t	stay	put	forever,	right?”	she	asked.	“Eventualy	he’l	need	to	get	to	the
MAV.”

“Not	necessarily,”	Venkat	said.	“JPL	is	experimenting	with	modifications	to	the
MDV	so	it	can	make	a	brief	overland	flight	after

landing.”

“I’d	heard	that	idea	was	rejected	as	being	too	dangerous,”	Cathy	said.

“Their	first	proposal	was,	yes.	Since	then,	they’ve	been	working	on	safer	ways	to
do	it.”

“With	only	three	and	a	half	years	before	Ares	4’s	scheduled	launch,	is	there
enough	time	to	make	and	test	modifications	to	the	MDV?”

“I	can’t	answer	that	for	sure.	But	remember,	we	made	a	lunar	lander	from	scratch
in	seven	years.”

“Excelent	point,”	Cathy	smiled.	“So	what	are	his	odds	right	now?”

“No	idea,”	Venkat	said.	“But	we’re	going	to	do	everything	we	can	to	bring	him
home	alive.”

“How’d	I	do	today?”	Venkat	asked.

“Eeeh,”	Annie	said.	“You	shouldn’t	say	things	like	‘Bring	him	home	alive.’	It
reminds	people	he	might	die.”

“Think	they’re	going	to	forget	that?”

“You	asked	my	opinion.	Don’t	like	it?	Go	fuck	yourself.”

“You’re	such	a	delicate	flower,	Annie.	How’d	you	end	up	NASA’s
Communications	Director?”

“Beats	the	fuck	out	of	me,”	Annie	said.

“Guys,”	said	Bruce	Ng,	Director	of	JPL.	“I	need	to	catch	a	flight	back	to	LA	in
three	hours.	Is	Teddy	coming	or	what?”

“Quit	bitching,	Bruce,”	Annie	said.	“None	of	us	want	to	be	here.”

“So,”	said	Hermes	Flight	Director	Mitch	Henderson	“Who	are	you,	again?”

“Um,”	Mindy	said,	“I’m	Mindy	Park.	I	work	in	SatCon.”

“You	a	director	or	something?”

“No,	I	just	work	in	SatCon.	I’m	a	nobody.”

Venkat	looked	to	Mitch	“I	put	her	in	charge	of	tracking	Watney.	She	gets	us	the
imagery.”

“Huh,”	said	Mitch.	“Not	the	Director	of	SatCon?”

“Bob’s	got	more	to	deal	with	than	just	Mars.	Mindy’s	handling	al	the	Martian
satelites,	and	keeps	them	pointed	at	Mark.”

“Why	Mindy?”	Mitch	asked.

“She	noticed	he	was	alive	in	the	first	place.”

“She	gets	a	promotion	cause	she	was	in	the	hot	seat	when	the	imagery	came
through?”

“No,”	Venkat	frowned,	“She	gets	a	promotion	cause	she	figured	out	he	was
alive.	Stop	being	a	dick,	Mitch.	You’re	making	her	feel

bad.”

Mitch	looked	over	to	Mindy.	“Sorry.”

Mindy	looked	at	the	table	and	managed	to	say	“’k.”

Teddy	entered	the	room.	“Sorry	I’m	late.	Let’s	get	started,”	He	took	his	seat.
“Venkat,	what’s	Watney’s	status?”

“Alive	and	wel,”	Venkat	said.	“No	change	from	my	email	earlier	today.”

“What	about	the	RTG.	Does	the	public	know	about	that	yet?”	Teddy	asked.

Annie	leaned	forward.	“So	far,	so	good,”	she	said.	“The	images	are	public,	but
we	have	no	obligation	to	tel	them	our	analysis.	Nobody

has	figured	it	out	yet.”

“Why	did	he	dig	it	up?”

“Heat,	I	think,”	Venkat	said.	“He	wants	to	make	the	rover	do	long	trips.	It	uses	a
lot	of	energy	keeping	warm.	The	RTG	can	heat	up

the	interior	without	soaking	battery	power.	It’s	a	good	idea,	realy.”

“How	dangerous	is	it?”	Teddy	asked.

“As	long	as	the	container’s	intact,	no	danger	at	al.	Even	if	it	cracks	open	he'l	be
ok	if	the	pelets	inside	don't	break.	But	if	the	pelets	break	too,	he’s	a	dead	man.”

“Let’s	hope	that	doesn’t	happen,”	Teddy	said.	“JPL,	how	are	the	MDV	plans
coming	along?”

“We	came	up	with	a	plan	a	long	time	ago,”	Bruce	said.	“You	rejected	it.”

“Bruce,”	Teddy	cautioned.

Bruce	sighed.	“The	MDV	wasn’t	made	for	liftoff	and	lateral	flight.	Packing	more
fuel	in	doesn’t	help.	We’d	need	a	bigger	engine	and

don’t	have	time	to	invent	one.	So	we	need	to	lighten	the	MDV.

“We	have	an	idea.	The	MDV	can	be	its	normal	weight	on	primary	descent.	If	we
made	the	heat	shield	and	outer	hul	detachable,	they

could	ditch	a	lot	of	weight	after	landing	at	Ares	3,	and	have	a	lighter	ship	for	the
traverse	to	Ares	4.	We’re	running	the	numbers	now.”

“Keep	me	posted,”	Teddy	said.	He	turned	to	Mindy.	“Miss	Park.	Welcome	to	the
big	leagues.”

“Sir,”	Mindy	said.

“What’s	the	biggest	gap	in	coverage	we	have	on	Watney	right	now?”

“Um,”	Mindy	said.	“Once	every	41	hours,	we’l	have	a	17	minute	gap.	The	orbits
work	out	that	way.”

“You	had	an	immediate	answer,”	Teddy	said.	“Good.”

“Thank	you,	sir.”

“I	want	that	gap	down	to	four	minutes,”	Teddy	said.	“I’m	giving	you	total
authority	over	satelite	trajectories	and	orbital	adjustments.

Make	it	happen.”

“Yes,	sir,”	Mindy	said,	with	no	idea	how	to	do	it.

Teddy	looked	to	Mitch.	“Mitch,	your	email	said	you	had	something	urgent?”

“Yeah,”	Mitch	said.	“How	long	are	we	gonna’	keep	this	from	the	Ares	3	crew?
They	al	think	Watney’s	dead.	It’s	a	huge	drain	on

morale.”

Teddy	looked	to	Venkat.

“Mitch,”	Venkat	said.	“We	discussed	this-“

“No,	you	discussed	it,”	Mitch	interrupted.	“They	think	they	lost	a	crewmate.
They’re	devastated.”

“And	when	they	find	out	they	abandoned	a	crewmate?”	Venkat	asked,	“Wil	they
feel	better	then?”

Mitch	poked	the	table	with	his	finger	“They	deserve	to	know.	You	don’t	think
Commander	Lewis	can’t	handle	the	truth?”

“It’s	a	matter	of	morale,”	Venkat	said.	“They	can	concentrate	on	getting	home-“

“I	make	that	cal,”	Mitch	said.	“I’m	the	one	who	decides	what’s	best	for	the	crew.
And	I	say	we	bring	them	up	to	speed.”

After	a	few	moments	of	silence,	al	eyes	turned	to	Teddy.

He	thought	for	a	moment.	“Sorry,	Mitch,	I’m	with	Venkat	on	this	one,”	he	said.
“But	as	soon	as	we	come	up	with	a	plan	for	rescue,	we

can	tel	Hermes.	There	needs	to	be	some	hope	or	there’s	no	point	in	teling	them.”

“Bulshit,”	Mitch	grumbled,	crossing	his	arms.	“Total	bulshit,”

“I	know	you’re	upset,”	Teddy	said	calmly,	“We’l	make	it	right.	Just	as	soon	as
we	have	some	idea	how	to	save	Watney.”

Teddy	let	a	few	seconds	of	calm	pass	before	moving	on.

“Ok,	JPL’s	on	the	rescue	option,”	he	said	with	a	nod	toward	Bruce.	“But	it	would
be	part	of	Ares	4.	How	does	he	stay	alive	til	then?

Venkat?”

Venkat	opened	a	folder	and	glanced	at	the	paperwork	inside.	“I	had	every	team
check	and	double-check	the	longevity	of	their

systems.	We’re	pretty	sure	the	Hab	can	keep	working	for	4	years.	Especialy	with
a	human	occupant	fixing	problems	as	they	arise.	But

there’s	no	way	around	the	food	issue.	He’l	start	starving	in	a	year.	We	have	to
send	him	supplies.	Simple	as	that.”

“What	about	an	Ares	4	presupply?”	Said	Teddy.	“Land	it	at	Ares	3	instead.”

“That’s	what	we’re	thinking,	yeah,”	Venkat	confirmed.	“Problem	is,	the	original
plan	was	to	launch	presupplies	a	year	from	now.

They’re	not	ready	yet.

“It	takes	8	months	to	get	a	probe	to	Mars	in	the	best	of	times.	The	positions	of
Earth	and	Mars	right	now…	it’s	not	the	best	of	times.

We	figure	we	can	get	there	in	9	months.	Presuming	he’s	rationing	his	food,	he’s
got	enough	to	last	350	more	days.	That	means	we	need	to

build	a	presupply	in	three	months.	JPL	hasn’t	even	started	yet.”

“That’l	be	tight,”	Bruce	said.	“Making	a	presupply	is	a	6	month	process.	We’re
set	up	to	pipeline	a	bunch	of	them	at	once,	not	to

make	one	in	a	hurry.”

“Sorry,	Bruce,”	Teddy	said.	“I	know	we’re	asking	a	lot,	but	you	have	to	find	a
way.”

“We’l	find	a	way,”	Bruce	said.	“But	the	OT	alone	wil	be	a	nightmare.”

“Get	started.	I’l	find	you	the	money.”

“There’s	also	the	booster,”	Venkat	said.	“The	only	way	to	get	a	probe	to	Mars
with	the	planets	in	their	current	positions	is	to	spend	a

butt-load	of	fuel.	We	only	have	one	booster	capable	of	doing	that.	The	Delta	IX
that’s	on	the	pad	right	now	for	the	EagleEye	3	Saturn

probe.	We’l	have	to	steal	that.	I	talked	to	ULA,	and	they	just	can’t	make	another
booster	in	time.”

“The	EagleEye	3	team	wil	be	pissed,	but	ok,”	said	Teddy.	“We	can	delay	their
mission	if	JPL	gets	the	payload	done	in	time.”

Bruce	rubbed	his	eyes.	“We’l	do	our	best.”

“He’l	starve	to	death	if	you	don’t,”	Teddy	said.

Venkat	sipped	his	coffee	and	frowned	at	his	computer.	A	month	ago	it	would
have	been	unthinkable	to	drink	coffee	at	9pm.	Now	it

was	necessary	fuel.	Shift	schedules,	fund	alocations,	project	juggling,	out	and
out	looting	of	other	projects…	he’d	never	puled	so	many

stunts	in	his	life.

“NASA’s	a	large	organization,”	he	typed.	“It	doesn’t	deal	with	sudden	change
well.	The	only	reason	we’re	getting	away	with	it

is	the	desperate	circumstances.	Everyone’s	pulling	together	to	save	Mark
Watney,	with	no	interdepartmental	squabbling.	I	can’t

tell	you	how	rare	that	is.	Even	then,	this	is	going	to	cost	tens	of	millions,	maybe
hundreds	of	millions	of	dollars.	The	MDV

modifications	alone	are	an	entire	project	that’s	being	staffed	up.	Hopefully,	the
public	interest	will	make	your	job	easier.	We

appreciate	your	continued	support,	Congressman,	and	hope	you	can	sway	the
Committee	toward	granting	us	the	emergency

funding	we	need.	”

He	was	interrupted	by	a	knock	at	his	door.	Looking	up,	he	saw	Mindy.

“Sorry	to	bother	you,”	Mindy	said.

“No	bother,”	Venkat	said.	“I	could	use	a	break.	What’s	up?”

“He’s	on	the	move,”	she	said.

Venkat	slouched	in	his	chair.	“Any	chance	it’s	a	test	drive?”

She	shook	her	head.	“He	drove	straight	away	from	the	Hab	for	almost	two	hours,
did	a	short	EVA,	then	drove	for	another	two.	We

think	the	EVA	was	to	change	batteries.”

Venkat	sighed	heavily.	“Maybe	it’s	just	a	longer	test?	An	overnight	trip,	kind	of
thing?”

“He’s	76km	from	the	Hab,”	Mindy	said.	“For	an	overnight	test,	wouldn’t	he	stay
within	walking	distance?”

“Yes	he	would,”	Venkat	said.	“Damn	it.	We’ve	had	teams	run	every	conceivable
scenario.	There’s	just	no	way	he	can	make	it	to	Ares

4	with	that	set-up.	We	never	saw	him	load	up	the	Oxygenator	or	Water
Reclaimer.	He	can’t	possibly	have	enough	basics	to	live	long

enough.”

“I	don’t	think	he’s	going	to	Ares	4,”	Mindy	said.	“If	he	is,	he’s	taking	a	weird
path.”

“Oh?”	said	Venkat.

“He	went	south-southwest.	Schiapareli	Crater	is	southeast.”

“Ok,	maybe	there’s	hope,”	Venkat	said.	“What’s	he	doing	right	now?”

“Recharging.	He’s	got	al	the	solar	cels	set	up,”	Mindy	said.	“Last	time	he	did
that,	it	took	12	hours.	I	was	going	to	sneak	home	for

some	sleep	if	that’s	ok.”

“Sure,	sounds	good.	We’l	see	what	he	does	tomorrow.	Maybe	he’l	go	back	to	the
Hab.”

“Maybe,”	Mindy	said,	unconvinced.

“Welcome	back,”	Cathy	said	to	the	camera.	“We’re	chatting	with	Marcus
Washington,	from	the	US	Postal	Service.	So,	Mr.

Washington,	I	understand	the	Ares	3	mission	caused	a	Postal	Service	first.	Can
you	explain	to	our	viewers?”

“Uh	yeah,”	said	Marcus.	“Everyone	thought	he	was	dead	for	over	two	months.
In	that	time,	the	Postal	Service	issued	a	run	of

commemorative	stamps	honoring	his	memory.	20,000	were	printed,	and	sent	to
post	offices	around	the	country.”

“And	then	it	turned	out	he	was	alive,”	Cathy	said.

“Yeah,”	said	Marcus.	“We	stopped	the	run	immediately	and	recaled	the	stamps,
but	thousands	were	already	sold.	The	thing	is,	we

don’t	print	stamps	of	living	people.”

“Has	this	ever	happened	before?”	Cathy	asked.

“No.	Not	once	in	the	history	of	the	Postal	Service.”

“I	bet	they’re	worth	a	pretty	penny	now.”

Marcus	chuckled.	“Maybe.	But	not	too	much.	Like	I	said,	thousands	were	sold.
They’l	be	rare,	but	not	super	rare.”

Cathy	chuckled	then	addressed	the	camera.	“We’ve	been	speaking	with	Marcus
Washington	of	the	United	States	Postal	Service.	If

you’ve	got	a	Mark	Watney	commemorative	stamp,	you	might	want	to	hold	on	to
it.	Thanks	for	dropping	by,	Mr.	Washington.”

“Thanks	for	having	me,”	Marcus	said.

“Our	next	guest	is	Dr.	Irene	Shields,	Flight	Psychologist	for	the	Ares	missions.
Dr.	Shields,	welcome	to	the	program.”

“Thank	you,”	Irene	said,	adjusting	her	microphone	clip.

“Do	you	know	Mark	Watney	personaly?”

“Of	course,”	Irene	said.	“I	did	monthly	psych	evaluations	on	each	member	of	the
crew.”

“What	can	you	tel	us	about	him?	His	personality,	his	mindset?”

“Wel,”	Irene	said,	“He’s	very	inteligent.	Al	of	them	are,	of	course.	But	he’s
particularly	resourceful	and	a	good	problem-solver.”

“That	may	save	his	life,”	Cathy	interjected.

“It	may	indeed,”	Irene	agreed.	“Also,	he’s	a	good-natured	man.	Usualy	cheerful,
with	a	great	sense	of	humor.	He’s	quick	with	a	joke.

In	the	months	leading	up	to	launch,	the	crew	was	put	through	a	grueling	training
schedule.	They	al	showed	signs	of	stress	and	moodiness.

Mark	was	no	exception,	but	the	way	he	showed	it	was	to	crack	more	jokes	and
get	everyone	laughing.”

“He	sounds	like	a	great	guy,”	Cathy	said.

“He	realy	is,”	Irene	said.	“He	was	chosen	for	the	mission	in	part	because	of	his
personality.	An	Ares	crew	has	to	spend	13	months

together.	Social	compatibility	is	key.	Mark	not	only	fits	wel	in	any	social	group,
he’s	a	catalyst	to	make	the	group	work	better.	It	was	a	terrible	blow	to	the	crew
when	he	‘died.’”

“And	they	stil	think	he’s	dead,	right?	The	Ares	3	crew?”

“Yes	they	do,	unfortunately,”	Irene	confirmed.	“The	higher-ups	decided	to	keep
it	from	them,	at	least	for	now.	I’m	sure	it	wasn’t	an

easy	decision.”

Cathy	paused	for	a	moment,	then	said.	“Al	right.	You	know	I	have	to	ask:	What’s
going	through	his	head	right	now?	How	does	a	man

like	Mark	Watney	respond	to	a	situation	like	this?	Stranded,	alone,	no	idea	we’re
trying	to	help?”

“There’s	no	way	to	be	sure,”	Irene	said.	“The	biggest	threat	is	giving	up	hope.	If
he	decides	there’s	no	chance	to	survive,	he’l	stop

trying.”

“Then	we’re	ok	for	now,	right?”	Cathy	said.	“He	seems	to	be	working	hard.	He’s
prepping	the	rover	for	a	long	trip	and	testing	it.	He

plans	to	be	there	when	Ares	4	lands.”

“That’s	one	interpretation,	yes,”	Irene	said.

“Is	there	another?”

Irene	carefuly	formed	her	answer	before	speaking.	“When	facing	death,	people
want	to	be	heard.	They	don’t	want	to	die	alone.	He

might	just	want	the	MAV	radio	so	he	can	talk	to	another	soul	before	he	dies.

“If	he’s	lost	hope,	he	won’t	care	about	survival.	His	only	concern	wil	be	making
it	to	the	radio.	After	that,	he’l	probably	take	an	easier	way	out	than	starvation.
The	medical	supplies	of	an	Ares	mission	have	enough	morphine	to	be	lethal.”

After	several	seconds	of	complete	silence	in	the	studio,	Cathy	turned	to	the
camera.	“We’l	be	right	back.”

“Heya,	Venk,”	came	Bruce’s	voice	from	the	speakerphone.

“Bruce,	Hi,”	said	Venkat.	“Thanks	for	clearing	up	some	time.	I	wanted	to	talk
about	the	presupply.”

“Sure	thing.	What’s	on	your	mind?”

“Let’s	say	we	soft-land	it	perfectly.	How	wil	Mark	know	it	happened?	And	how
wil	he	know	where	to	look?”

“We’ve	been	thinking	about	that,”	said	Bruce.	“We’ve	got	some	ideas.”

“I’m	al	ears,”	Venkat	said.

“We’l	be	sending	him	a	comm	system	anyway,	right?	We	could	have	it	turn	on
after	lading.	It’l	broadcast	on	the	rover	and	EVA	suit

frequencies.	It’l	have	to	be	a	strong	signal,	too.

“The	rovers	were	only	designed	to	communicate	with	the	Hab	and	each	other;
the	signal	origin	was	presumed	to	be	within	20km.	The

receivers	just	aren’t	very	sensitive.	The	EVA	suits	are	even	worse.	But	as	long	as
we	have	a	strong	signal	we	should	be	good.

“Once	we	land	the	presupply,	we’l	get	its	exact	location	from	satelites,	then
broadcast	that	to	Mark	so	he	can	go	get	it.”

“But	he’s	probably	not	listening,”	said	Venkat.	“Why	would	he	be?”

“We	have	a	plan	for	that.	We’re	going	to	make	a	bunch	of	bright	green	ribbons.
Light	enough	to	flutter	around	when	dropped,	even	in

Mars’s	atmosphere.	Each	ribbon	wil	have	‘MARK:	TURN	ON	YOUR	COMM’
printed	on	it.	We’re	working	on	a	release	mechanism

now.	During	the	landing	sequence,	of	course.	Idealy,	about	1000	meters	above
the	surface.”

“I	like	it,”	Venkat	said.	“Al	he	needs	to	do	is	notice	one.	And	he’s	sure	to	check
out	a	bright	green	ribbon	if	he	sees	one	outside.”

“That’s	what	we’re	thinking,”	said	Bruce.

“Al	right,	good	work.	Keep	me	posted,”	Venkat	said.

“Venk,”	said	Bruce.	“If	he	takes	the	‘Watneymobile’	to	Ares	4,	this’l	al	be	for
nothing.	I	mean,	we	can	land	it	at	Ares	4	if	that

happens,	but…”

“But	he’l	be	without	a	Hab.	Yeah,”	Venkat	said.	“One	thing	at	a	time.	Let	me
know	when	you	come	up	with	a	release	mechanism	for

those	ribbons.”

“Wil	do.”

After	terminating	the	cal,	he	saw	an	email	from	Mindy	Park	arrive.	“Watney’s	on
the	move	again.	”

“Stil	going	in	a	straight	line,”	Mindy	said,	pointing	to	her	monitor.

“I	see,”	Venkat	said.	“He’s	sure	as	hel	not	going	to	Ares	4.	Unless	he’s	going
around	some	natural	obstacle.”

“There’s	nothing	for	him	to	go	around,”	Mindy	said.	“It’s	Acidalia	Planitia.”

“Are	those	the	solar	cels?”	Venkat	asked,	pointing	to	the	screen.

“Yeah,”	Mindy	said.	“He	did	the	usual	2	hour	drive,	EVA,	2	hour	drive.	He’s
156km	from	the	Hab	now.”

They	both	peered	at	the	screen.

“Wait…”	Venkat	said.	“Wait,	no	way…”

“What?”	Mindy	asked.

Venkat	grabbed	a	pad	of	Post-Its	and	a	pen.	“Give	me	his	location,	and	the
location	of	the	Hab.”

Mindy	checked	her	screen.	“He’s	currently	at…	28.9°N,	29.6°W.”	With	a	few
keystrokes,	she	brought	up	another	file.	“The	Hab’s	at

31.2°N,	28.5°W.	What	do	you	see?”

Venkat	finished	taking	down	the	numbers.	“Come	with	me,”	he	said,	quickly
walking	out.

“Um,”	Mindy	stammered,	folowing	after.	“Where	are	we	going?”	She	asked
when	she	caught	up.

“SatCon	break	room,”	Venkat	said.	“You	guys	stil	have	that	map	of	Mars	on	the
wal?”

“Sure,”	Mindy	said.	“But	it’s	just	a	poster	from	the	gift	shop.	I’ve	got	high
quality	digital	maps	on	my	computer-“

“Nope.	I	can’t	draw	on	those,”	he	said.	Then,	rounding	the	corner	to	the	break
room,	he	pointed	to	the	Mars	map	on	the	wal.	“I	can

draw	on	that.”

The	break	room	was	empty	save	a	computer	technician	sipping	a	cup	of	coffee.
The	urgency	of	Venkat	and	Mindy’s	entrance	caught

his	attention.

“Good,	it	has	latitude	and	longitude	lines,”	Venkat	said.	Looking	at	his	Post-It,
then	sliding	his	finger	along	the	map,	he	drew	an	X.

“That’s	the	Hab,”	he	said.

“Hey,”	the	technician	said.	“Are	you	drawing	on	our	poster?”

“I’l	buy	you	a	new	one,”	Venkat	said	without	looking	back.	Then,	he	drew
another	X.	“That’s	his	current	location.	Get	me	a	ruler.”

Mindy	looked	left	and	right.	Seeing	no	ruler,	she	grabbed	the	technicians
notebook.

“Hey!”	The	technician	protested.

Using	the	notebook	as	a	straight-edge,	Venkat	drew	a	line	from	the	Hab	to
Mark’s	location	and	beyond.	Then	took	a	step	back.

“Yup!	That’s	where	he’s	going!”	Venkat	said	excitedly.

“Oh!”	Mindy	said.

The	line	passed	through	the	exact	center	of	a	bright	yelow	dot	printed	on	the
map.

“Pathfinder!”	Mindy	said.	“He’s	going	to	Pathfinder!”

“Yup!”	Venkat	said.	“Now	we’re	getting	somewhere.	It’s	like	800km	from	him.

He	can	get	there	and	back	with	supplies	on-hand.”

“And	bring	Pathfinder	and	Sojourner	Rover	back	with	him,”	Mindy	added.

Venkat	quickly	puled	out	his	cel	phone.	“We	lost	contact	with	it	in	1997.	If	he
can	get	it	online	again,	we	can	communicate.	It	might

just	need	the	solar	cels	cleaned.	Even	if	it’s	got	a	bigger	problem,	he’s	an
engineer!”	Dialing,	he	added	“Fixing	shit	is	his	job!”

Smiling	for	the	first	time	in	weeks,	he	held	the	phone	to	his	ear	and	awaited	a
response.	“Bruce?	It’s	Venkat.	Everything	just	changed.

Watney’s	headed	for	Pathfinder.	Yeah!	I	know,	right!?	Dig	up	everyone	who	was
on	that	project	and	get	them	to	JPL	now.	I’l	catch	the

next	flight.”

Hanging	up,	he	grinned	at	the	map.	“Mark,	you	sneaky,	clever,	son	of	a	bitch!”

Chapter	9

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	79

It’s	the	evening	of	my	8th	day	on	the	road.	“Sirius	4”	has	been	a	success	so	far.

I’ve	falen	in	to	a	routine.	Every	morning	I	wake	up	at	dawn.	First	thing	I	do	is
check	oxygen	and	CO2	levels.	Then	I	eat	a	breakfast

pack	and	drink	a	cup	of	water.	After	that,	I	brush	my	teeth,	using	as	little	water
as	possible,	and	shave	with	an	electric	razor.

The	rover	has	no	toilet.	We	were	expected	to	use	our	suits’	reclamation	systems
for	that.	But	they	aren’t	designed	to	hold	twenty	days

worth	of	output.

My	morning	piss	goes	in	a	resealable	plastic	box.	When	I	open	it,	the	rover	reeks
like	a	truck-stop	men’s	room.	I	could	take	it	outside

and	let	it	boil	off.	But	I	worked	hard	to	make	that	water,	and	the	last	thing	I’m
going	to	do	is	waste	it.	I’l	feed	it	to	the	Water	Reclaimer	when	I	get	back.

Even	more	precious	is	my	manure.	It’s	critical	to	the	potato	farm	and	I’m	the
only	source	on	Mars.	Fortunately,	when	you	spend	a	lot

of	time	in	space,	you	learn	how	to	shit	in	a	bag.	And	if	you	think	things	are	bad
after	opening	the	piss	box,	imagine	the	smel	after	I	drop	anchor.

Then	I	go	outside	and	colect	the	solar	cels.	Why	didn’t	I	do	it	the	previous	night?
Because	trying	to	dismantle	and	stack	solar	cels	in

total	fucking	darkness	isn’t	fun.	I	learned	that	the	hard	way.

After	securing	the	cels,	I	come	back	in,	turn	on	some	shitty	‘70’s	music,	and	start
driving.	I	putter	along	at	25kph,	the	rover’s	top

speed.	It’s	comfortable	inside.	I	wear	hastily	made	cut-offs	and	a	thin	shirt	while

the	RTG	bakes	the	interior.	When	it	gets	too	hot	I	detach	the	insulation	duct-
taped	to	the	hul.	When	it	gets	too	cold,	I	tape	it	back	up.

I	can	go	almost	2	hours	before	the	battery	runs	out.	I	do	a	quick	EVA	to	swap
cables,	then	I’m	back	at	the	wheel	for	the	second	half

of	the	day’s	drive.

The	terrain	is	very	flat.	The	undercarriage	of	the	rover	is	taler	than	any	of	the
rocks	around	here,	and	the	hils	are	gently-sloping	affairs,	smoothed	by	eons	of
sandstorms.

When	the	other	battery	runs	out,	it’s	time	for	another	EVA.	I	pul	the	solar	cels	off
the	roof	and	lay	them	on	the	ground.	For	the	first

few	sols,	I	lined	them	up	in	a	row.	Now	I	plop	them	wherever,	trying	to	keep
them	close	to	the	rover	out	of	sheer	laziness.

Then	comes	the	incredibly	dul	part	of	my	day.	I	sit	around	for	12	hours	with
nothing	to	do.	And	I’m	getting	sick	of	this	rover.	The

inside’s	the	size	of	a	van.	That	may	seem	like	plenty	of	room,	but	try	being
trapped	in	a	van	for	8	days.	I	look	forward	to	tending	my	potato	farm	in	the	wide
open	space	of	the	Hab.

I’m	nostalgic	for	the	Hab.	How	fucked	up	is	that?

I	have	shitty	‘70’s	TV	to	watch,	and	a	bunch	of	Poirot	novels.	But	mostly	I	spend
my	time	thinking	about	getting	to	Ares	4.	I’l	have	to

do	it	someday.	How	the	hel	am	I	going	to	survive	a	3,200km	trip	in	this	thing?
It’l	probably	take	50	days.	I’l	need	the	Water	Reclaimer

and	the	Oxygenator,	maybe	some	of	the	Hab’s	main	batteries,	then	a	bunch	more
solar	cels	to	charge	everything…	where	wil	I	put	it	al?

These	thoughts	pester	me	throughout	the	long	boring	days.

Eventualy,	it	gets	dark	and	I	get	tired.	I	lay	among	the	food	packs,	water	tanks,
extra	O2	tank,	piles	of	CO2	filters,	box	of	pee,	bags

of	shit,	and	personal	items.	I	have	a	bunch	of	crew	jumpsuits	to	serve	as	bedding,
along	with	my	blanket	and	pilow.	Basicaly,	I	sleep	in	a	pile	of	junk	every	night.

Speaking	of	sleep…	G’night.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	80

By	my	reckoning,	I’m	about	100km	from	Pathfinder.	Technicaly	it’s	“Carl	Sagan
Memorial	Station.”	But	with	al	due	respect	to	Carl,	I	can	cal	it	whatever	the	hel	I
want.	I’m	the	King	of	Mars.

As	I	mentioned,	it’s	been	a	long,	boring	drive.	And	I’m	stil	on	the	outward	leg.
But	hey,	I’m	an	astronaut.	Long-ass	trips	are	my

business.

Navigation	is	tricky.

The	Hab’s	nav	beacon	only	reaches	40km,	then	it’s	too	faint.	I	knew	that’d	be	an
issue	when	I	was	planning	this	little	road	trip,	so	I

came	up	with	a	briliant	plan	that	didn’t	work.

The	computer	has	detailed	maps,	so	I	figured	I	could	navigate	by	landmarks.	I
was	wrong.	Turns	out	you	can’t	navigate	by	landmarks	if

you	can’t	find	any	god	damned	landmarks.

Our	landing	site	is	at	the	delta	of	a	long-gone	river.	If	there	are	any	microscopic
fossils	to	be	had,	it’s	a	good	place	to	look.	Also,	the	water	would	have	dragged
rock	and	soil	samples	from	thousands	of	kilometers	away.	With	some	digging,
we	could	get	a	broad	geological

history.

That’s	great	for	science,	but	it	means	the	Hab’s	in	a	featureless	wasteland.

I	considered	making	a	compass.	The	rover	has	plenty	of	electricity	and	the	med
kit	has	a	needle.	Only	one	problem:	Mars	doesn’t	have

a	magnetic	field.

So	I	navigate	by	Phobos.	It	whips	around	Mars	so	fast	it	actualy	rises	and	sets
twice	a	day,	running	west	to	east.	It’s	isn’t	the	most

accurate	system,	but	it	works.

Things	got	easier	on	Sol	75.	I	reached	a	valey	with	a	rise	to	the	west.	It	had	flat
ground	for	easy	driving,	and	I	just	needed	to	folow	the	edge	of	the	hils.	I	named
it	“Lewis	Valey”	after	our	fearless	leader.	She’d	love	it	there,	geology	nerd	that
she	is.

Three	sols	later,	Lewis	Valey	opened	into	a	wide	plain.	So,	again,	I	was	left
without	references	and	relied	on	Phobos	to	guide	me.

There’s	probably	symbolism	there.	Phobos	is	the	god	of	fear,	and	I’m	letting	it
be	my	guide.	Not	a	good	sign.

But	today,	my	luck	finaly	changed.	After	two	sols	wandering	the	desert,	I	found
something	to	navigate	by.	It	was	a	5km	crater,	so

smal	it	didn’t	even	have	a	listed	name.	But	to	me,	it	was	the	Lighthouse	of
Alexandria.	Once	I	had	it	in	sight,	I	knew	exactly	where	I	was.

I’m	camped	near	it	now,	as	a	matter	of	fact.

I’m	finaly	through	the	blank	areas	of	the	map.	Tomorrow,	I’l	have	the
Lighthouse	to	navigate	by,	and	Hamelin	crater	later	on.	I’m	in

good	shape.

Now,	on	to	my	next	task:	Sitting	around	with	nothing	to	do	for	12	hours.

I	better	get	started!

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	81

Almost	made	it	to	Pathfinder	today,	but	I	ran	out	of	juice.	Just	another	22km	to
go!

An	unremarkable	drive.	Navigation	wasn’t	a	problem.	As	Lighthouse	receded
into	the	distance,	the	rim	of	Hamelin	Crater	came	in	to

view.

I	left	Acidalia	Planitia	behind	a	long	time	ago.	I’m	wel	into	Ares	Valis	now.	The
desert	plains	are	giving	way	to	bumpier	terrain,	strewn	with	ejecta	that	never	got
buried	by	sand.	It	makes	driving	a	chore;	I	have	to	pay	more	attention.

Up	til	now,	I’ve	been	driving	right	over	the	rock-strewn	landscape.	But	as	I
travel	further	south,	the	rocks	are	getting	bigger	and	more	plentiful.	I	have	to	go
around	some	of	them	or	risk	damage	to	my	suspension.	The	good	news	is	I	don’t
have	to	do	it	for	long.	Once	I	get	to	Pathfinder,	I	can	turn	around	and	go	the
other	way.

The	weather’s	been	very	good.	No	discernible	wind,	no	storms.	I	think	I	got
lucky	there.	There’s	a	good	chance	my	rover	tracks	from

the	past	few	sols	are	intact.	I	should	be	able	to	get	back	to	Lewis	Valey	just	by
folowing	them.

After	setting	up	the	solar	panels,	I	went	for	a	little	walk.	I	never	left	sight	of	the
rover;	the	last	thing	I	want	to	do	is	get	lost	on	foot.	But	I	couldn’t	stomach
crawling	back	into	that	cramped,	smely	rat’s	nest.	Not	right	away.

It’s	a	strange	feeling.	Everywhere	I	go,	I’m	the	first.	Step	outside	the	rover?	First
guy	ever	to	be	there!	Climb	a	hil?	First	guy	to	climb	that	hil!	Kick	a	rock?	That
rock	hadn’t	moved	in	a	milion	years!

I’m	the	first	guy	to	drive	long-distance	on	Mars.	The	first	guy	to	spend	more
than	31	sols	on	Mars.	The	first	guy	to	grow	crops	on

Mars.	First,	first,	first!

I	wasn’t	expecting	to	be	first	at	anything.	I	was	the	5th	crewman	out	of	the	MDV
when	we	landed,	making	me	the	17th	person	to	set

foot	on	Mars.	The	egress	order	had	been	determined	years	earlier.	A	month
before	launch,	we	al	got	tattoos	of	our	“Mars	Numbers.”

Johanssen	almost	refused	to	get	her	“15”	because	she	was	afraid	it	would	hurt.
Here’s	a	woman	who	had	survived	the	centrifuge,	the	vomit	comet,	hard	landing
drils	and	10k	runs.	A	woman	who	fixed	a	simulated	MDV	computer	failure

while	being	spun	around	upside-down.	But

she	was	afraid	of	a	tattoo	needle.

Man,	I	miss	those	guys.

I’m	the	first	person	to	be	alone	on	an	entire	planet.

Ok,	enough	moping.	Tomorrow,	I’l	be	the	first	person	to	recover	a	Mars	probe.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	82

Victory!	I	found	it!

I	knew	I	was	in	the	right	area	when	I	spotted	Twin	Peaks	in	the	distance.	The
two	smal	hils	are	under	a	kilometer	from	the	landing	site.

Even	better,	they	were	on	the	far	side	of	the	site.	Al	I	had	to	do	was	aim	for	them
until	I	found	the	Lander.

And	there	it	was!	Right	where	it	was	supposed	to	be!

Pathfinder’s	final	stage	of	descent	was	a	baloon-covered	tetrahedron.	The
baloons	absorbed	the	impact	of	landing.	Once	it	came	to

rest,	they	deflated	and	the	tetrahedron	unfolded	to	reveal	the	probe.

It’s	actualy	two	separate	components.	The	Lander	itself,	and	the	Sojourner	rover.
The	Lander	was	immobile,	while	Sojourner

wandered	around	and	got	a	good	look	at	the	local	rocks.	I’m	taking	both	back
with	me,	but	the	important	part	is	the	Lander.	That’s	the

part	that	can	communicate	with	Earth.

I	excitedly	stumbled	out	and	rushed	to	the	site.

I	can’t	explain	how	happy	I	was.	It	was	a	lot	of	work	to	get	here,	and	I’d
succeeded.

The	Lander	was	half	buried.	With	some	quick	and	careful	digging,	I	exposed	the

bulk	of	it,	though	the	large	tetrahedron	and	the

deflated	baloons	stil	lurked	below	the	surface.

After	a	quick	search,	I	found	Sojourner.	The	little	fela	was	only	two	meters	from
the	Lander.	I	vaguely	remember	it	was	further	away

when	they	last	saw	it.	It	probably	entered	a	contingency	mode	and	started
circling	the	Lander,	trying	to	communicate.

I	quickly	deposited	Sojourner	in	my	rover.	It’s	smal,	light,	and	easily	fit	in	the
airlock.	The	Lander	was	a	different	story.

I	had	no	hope	of	getting	the	whole	thing	back	to	the	Hab.	It	was	just	too	big.	It
was	time	for	me	to	put	on	my	mechanical	engineer	hat.

The	probe	was	attached	to	the	central	panel	of	the	unfolded	tetrahedron.	The
other	three	sides	were	each	attached	with	a	metal	hinge.

As	anyone	at	JPL	wil	tel	you,	probes	are	delicate	things.	Weight	is	a	serious
concern,	so	they’re	not	made	to	stand	up	to	much

punishment.

When	I	took	a	crowbar	to	the	hinges,	they	popped	right	off!

Then	things	got	difficult.	When	I	tried	to	lift	the	central	panel	assembly,	it	didn’t
budge.

Just	like	the	other	three	panels,	the	central	panel	had	deflated	baloons	underneath
it.

Over	the	decades,	the	baloons	had	ripped	and	filed	with	sand.

I	could	cut	off	the	baloons,	but	I’d	have	to	dig	to	get	to	them.	It	wouldn’t	be
hard,	it’s	just	sand.	But	the	other	three	panels	were	in	the	damn	way.

I	quickly	realized	I	didn’t	give	a	crap	about	the	condition	of	the	other	panels.	I
went	back	to	my	rover,	cut	some	strips	of	Hab	material,	then	braided	them	in	to	a
primitive	but	strong	rope.	I	can’t	take	credit	for	it	being	strong.	Thank	NASA	for

that.	I	just	made	it	rope-shaped.

I	tied	one	end	to	a	panel,	and	the	other	to	the	rover.	The	rover	was	made	for
traversing	extremely	rugged	terrain,	often	at	steep	angles.

It	may	not	be	fast,	but	it	has	great	torque.	I	towed	the	panel	away	like	a	redneck
removing	a	tree	stump.

Now	I	had	a	place	to	dig.	As	I	exposed	each	baloon,	I	cut	it	off.	The	whole	task
took	an	hour.

Then	I	hoisted	the	central	panel	assembly	up	and	carried	it	confidently	to	the
rover!

At	least,	that’s	what	I	wanted	to	do.	The	damn	thing	is	stil	heavy	as	hel.	I’m
guessing	it’s	200kg.	Even	in	Mar's	gravity	that's	a	bit

much.	I	could	carry	it	around	the	Hab	easily	enough,	but	lifting	it	while	wearing
an	awkward	EVA	suit?	Out	of	the	question.

So	I	dragged	it	to	the	rover.

Now	for	my	next	feat:	Getting	it	on	the	roof.

The	roof	was	empty	at	the	moment.	Even	with	mostly-ful	batteries,	I	had	set	up
the	solar	cels	when	I	stopped.	Why	not?	Free	energy.

I’d	worked	it	out	in	advance.	On	the	way	here,	two	stacks	of	solar	panels
occupied	the	whole	roof.	On	the	way	back,	they	would	be	a

single	stack.	It’s	a	little	more	dangerous;	they	might	fal	over.	The	main	thing	it
they’l	be	a	pain	in	the	ass	to	stack	that	high.

I	can’t	just	throw	a	rope	over	the	rover	and	hoist	Pathfinder	up	the	side.	I	don’t
want	to	break	it.	I	mean,	it’s	already	broken,	they	lost	contact	in	1997.	But	I
don’t	want	to	break	it	more.

I	came	up	with	a	solution,	but	I’d	done	enough	physical	labor	for	one	day,	and	I
was	almost	out	of	daylight.

Now	I’m	in	the	rover,	looking	at	Sojourner.	It	seems	al	right.	No	physical
damage	on	the	outside.	Doesn’t	look	like	anything	got	too

baked	by	the	sunlight.	The	dense	layer	of	Mars	crap	al	over	it	protected	it	from
long-term	solar	damage.

You	may	think	Sojourner	isn’t	much	use	to	me.	It	can’t	communicate	with	Earth.
Why	do	I	care	about	it?

Because	it	has	a	lot	of	moving	parts.

If	I	establish	a	link	with	NASA,	I	can	talk	to	them	by	holding	a	page	of	text	up	to
the	Lander’s	camera.	But	how	would	they	talk	to

me?	The	only	moving	parts	on	the	Lander	are	the	high	gain	antenna	(which
would	have	to	stay	pointed	at	Earth)	and	the	camera	boom.

We’d	have	to	come	up	with	a	system	where	NASA	could	talk	by	rotating	the
camera	head.	It	would	be	painfuly	slow.

But	Sojourner	has	six	independent	wheels	that	rotate	reasonably	fast.	It’l	be
much	easier	to	communicate	with	those.	If	nothing	else,	I

could	draw	letters	on	the	wheels,	and	hold	a	mirror	up	to	its	camera.	NASA’d
figure	it	out	and	start	speling	things	at	me.

That	al	assumes	I	can	get	the	Lander’s	radio	working	at	al.

Time	to	turn	in.	I’ve	got	a	lot	of	backbreaking	physical	labor	to	do	tomorrow.	I’l
need	my	rest.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	83

Oh	god	I’m	sore.

But	it’s	the	only	way	I	could	think	of	to	get	the	Lander	safely	on	to	the	roof.

I	built	a	ramp	out	of	rocks	and	sand.	Just	like	the	ancient	Egyptians	did.

And	if	there’s	one	thing	Ares	Valis	has,	it’s	rocks!

First,	I	experimented	to	find	out	how	steep	the	grade	could	be.	Piling	up	some
rocks	near	the	Lander,	I	dragged	it	up	the	pile,	then

down	again.	Then	I	made	it	steeper,	etc.	I	figured	out	I	could	pul	it	up	a	30
degree	grade.	Anything	more	was	too	risky.	I	might	lose	my	grip	and	send	the
Lander	tumbling	down	the	ramp.

The	roof	of	the	rover	is	over	2	meters	from	the	ground.	So	I’d	need	a	ramp
almost	4	meters	long.	I	got	to	work.

The	first	few	rocks	were	easy.	Then	they	started	feeling	heavier	and	heavier.
Hard	physical	labor	in	a	spacesuit	is	murder.	Everything’s	more	effort	because
you’re	lugging	20kg	of	suit	around	with	you,	and	your	movement	is	limited.	I
was	panting	within	20	minutes.

So	I	cheated.	I	upped	my	O2	mixture.	It	realy	helped	a	lot.	Probably	shouldn’t
make	that	a	habit.	Also,	I	didn’t	get	hot.	The	suit	leaks	heat	faster	than	my	body
could	ever	generate	it.	The	heating	system	is	what	keeps	the	temperature
bearable.	My	physical	labor	just	meant	the	suit	didn’t	have	to	heat	itself	as	much.

After	hours	of	grueling	labor,	I	finaly	got	the	ramp	made.	Nothing	more	than	a
pile	of	rocks	against	the	rover,	but	it	reached	the	roof.

I	stomped	up	and	down	the	ramp	first,	to	make	sure	it	was	stable,	then	I	dragged
the	Lander	up.	It	worked	like	a	charm!

I	was	al	smiles	as	I	lashed	the	Lander	in	place.	I	made	sure	it	was	firmly	secured,
and	even	stacked	the	solar	cels	in	a	big	single	stack	(why	waste	the	ramp?).

But	then	it	hit	me.	The	ramp	would	colapse	as	I	drove	away,	and	the	rocks	might
damage	the	wheels	or	undercarriage.	I’d	have	to

take	the	ramp	apart	to	keep	that	from	happening.

Ugh.

Tearing	the	ramp	down	was	easier	than	putting	it	up.	I	didn’t	need	to	carefuly	put
each	rock	in	a	stable	place.	I	just	dropped	them

wherever.	It	only	took	me	an	hour.

And	now	I’m	done!

I’l	start	heading	home	tomorrow,	with	my	new	100kg	broken	radio.

Seven	days	since	Pathfinder,	and	seven	days	closer	to	home.

As	I’d	hoped,	my	inbound	tracks	gave	me	a	path	back	to	Lewis	Valey.	Then	it
was	four	sols	of	easy	driving.	The	hils	to	my	left	made

it	impossible	to	get	lost,	and	the	terrain	was	smooth.

But	al	good	things	come	to	an	end.	I’m	back	in	Acidalia	Planitia	now.	My
outgoing	tracks	are	long	gone.	It’s	been	16	days	since	I	was

On	my	way	out,	I	should	have	made	a	pile	of	rocks	every	time	I	camped.	The

On	second	thought,	thinking	back	to	making	that	damn	ramp…	ugh.

So	once	again	I	am	the	desert	wanderer,	using	Phobos	to	navigate,	and	hoping	I
don’t	stray	too	far.	Al	I	need	to	do	is	get	within	40km

of	the	Hab	and	I’l	pick	up	the	beacon.

I’m	feeling	optimistic.	For	the	first	time,	I	think	I	might	get	off	this	planet	alive.
With	that	in	mind,	I’m	taking	soil	and	rock	samples	every	time	I	do	an	EVA.

At	first,	I	figured	it	was	my	duty.	If	I	survive,	geologists	wil	love	me	for	it.	But
then	it	started	to	get	fun.	Now,	as	I	drive,	I	look	forward	to	that	simple	act	of

It	just	feels	nice	to	be	an	astronaut	again.	That’s	al	it	is.	Not	a	reluctant	farmer,

interplanetary	travel,	I	can	tel	you	there	are	no	scientific	inaccuracies	in	the
story.	It’s	quite	common	for	probes	to	land	on	the	wrong	planet.	Also,	the
probe’s	large,	flat-panel	hul	is	ideal	for	the	high-pressure	Venusian	atmosphere.
And,	as	we	al	know,	probes	often	refuse	to	obey	directives,	choosing	instead	to
attack	humans	on	sight.

So	far,	Pathfinder	hasn’t	tried	kil	me.	But	I’m	keeping	an	eye	on	it.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	93

I’l	be	home	tomorrow.	Even	if	the	rover	has	a	catastrophic	failure,	I’l	be	fine.	I

I	don’t	know	if	I’ve	mentioned	this	before,	but	I	am	realy	fucking	sick	of	being

At	this	point	I’d	welcome	a	health	lecture.

During	training,	we	had	to	practice	the	dreaded	“Missed	Orbit”	scenario.	In	the
event	of	a	second-stage	failure	during	MAV	ascent,

we’d	be	in	orbit,	but	too	low	to	reach	Hermes.	We’d	be	skimming	the	upper
atmosphere,	so	our	orbit	would	rapidly	decay.	NASA	would

remotely	operate	Hermes	and	bring	it	in	for	rendezvous.	Then	we’d	get	the	hel
out	of	there	before	Hermes	caught	too	much	drag.

To	dril	this,	they	made	us	stay	in	the	MAV	simulator	for	3	miserable	days.	Six
people	in	an	ascent	vehicle	originaly	designed	for	a	23

minute	flight.	It	got	a	little	cramped.	And	by	“a	little	cramped”	I	mean	“We
wanted	to	kil	each	other”.

Once	we	got	out,	Commander	Lewis	declared	“what	happened	in	Missed	Orbit
stays	in	Missed	Orbit.”	It	may	seem	trite,	but	it

worked.	We	put	it	behind	us	and	got	back	to	normal.

I’d	give	anything	for	just	five	minutes	of	Missed	Orbit	training.	I’m	realy	feeling
alone	lately.	Up	til	this	road	trip,	I’ve	been	too	busy	to	mope.	But	the	long,	dul
days	with	nothing	to	do	realy	drives	it	home.	I’m	further	away	from	other
humans	than	anyone	has	ever	been.

Man,	I	hope	I	get	Pathfinder	working	again.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	94

Home	sweet	home!

Today	I	write	from	my	gigantic,	cavernous	Hab!

The	first	thing	I	did	when	I	got	in	was	wave	my	arms	wildly	while	running	in
circles.	Felt	great!	I	was	in	that	damn	rover	for	22	sols,	and	couldn’t	even	walk
without	suiting	up.

I’l	need	to	endure	twice	that	to	get	to	Ares	4,	but	that’s	a	problem	for	later.

After	a	few	celebratory	laps	around	the	Hab,	it	was	time	to	get	to	work.

First,	I	fired	up	the	Oxygenator	and	Atmospheric	Regulator.	Checking	the	air
levels,	everything	looked	good.	There	was	stil	CO2,	so

the	plants	hadn’t	suffocated	without	me	exhaling	for	them.

Naturaly	I	did	an	exhaustive	check	on	my	crops,	and	they’re	al	healthy.

I	added	my	bags	of	shit	to	the	manure	pile.	Lovely	smel,	I	can	tel	you.	But	once	I
mixed	some	soil	in,	it	died	down	to	tolerable	levels.	I	dumped	my	box	o’	pee	into
the	Water	Reclaimer.

I’d	been	gone	over	three	weeks,	and	had	left	the	Hab	very	humid	for	the	sake	of
the	crops.	That	much	water	in	the	air	can	cause	any

amount	of	electrical	problems,	so	I	spent	the	next	few	hours	doing	ful	systems
checks	on	everything.

Then	I	kind	of	lounged	around	for	a	while.	I	wanted	to	spend	the	rest	of	the	day
relaxing,	but	I	had	more	to	do.

Suiting	up,	I	went	out	to	the	rover	and	dragged	the	solar	cels	off	the	roof.	Over
the	next	few	hours,	I	put	them	back	where	they

belonged,	wiring	them	into	the	Hab’s	power	grid.

Getting	the	Lander	off	the	roof	was	a	hel	of	a	lot	easier	than	getting	it	up	there.	I
detached	a	strut	from	the	MAV	platform	and	dragged	it	over	to	the	rover.
Leaning	it	against	the	hul	and	digging	the	other	end	in	to	the	ground	for	stability,
I	had	a	ramp.

I	should	have	brought	that	strut	with	me	to	the	Pathfinder	site.	Live	and	learn.

There’s	no	way	to	get	the	Lander	in	the	airlock.	It’s	just	too	big.	I	could	probably
dismantle	it	and	bring	it	in	a	piece	at	a	time,	but	there’s	a	pretty	compeling
reason	not	to.

With	no	magnetic	field,	Mars	has	no	defense	against	harsh	solar	radiation.	If	I
were	exposed	to	it,	I’d	get	so	much	cancer,	the	cancer

would	have	cancer.	So	the	Hab	canvas	shields	from	electromagnetic	waves.	This
means	the	Hab	itself	it	would	block	any	transmissions	if

the	Lander	were	inside.

Speaking	of	cancer,	it	was	time	to	get	rid	of	the	RTG.

It	pained	me	to	climb	back	into	the	rover,	but	it	had	to	be	done.	If	the	RTG	ever
broke	open,	it	would	kil	me	to	death.

NASA	decided	4km	was	the	safe	distance,	and	I	wasn’t	about	to	second-guess
them.	Driving	back	to	where	Commander	Lewis	had

originaly	dumped	it,	I	ditched	it	in	the	same	hole	and	drove	back	to	the	Hab.

I’l	start	work	on	the	Lander	tomorrow.

Now,	to	enjoy	a	good,	long	sleep	in	an	actual	cot.	With	the	comforting
knowledge	that	when	I	wake,	my	morning	piss	wil	go	into	a

toilet.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	95

Today	was	al	about	repairs!

The	Pathfinder	mission	ended	because	the	Lander	had	an	unknown	critical
failure.	Once	they	lost	contact	with	the	Lander,	they	had	no

idea	what	became	of	Sojourner.	It	might	be	in	better	shape.	Maybe	it	just	needs
power.	Power	it	couldn’t	get	with	the	solar	panels

hopelessly	caked	with	dust.

Setting	it	on	my	workbench,	I	pried	open	a	panel	to	peek	inside.	The	battery	was
a	lithium	thionyl	chloride	non-rechargeable.	I	figured

that	out	from	some	subtle	clues:	the	shape	of	the	connection	points,	the	thickness

of	the	insulation,	and	the	fact	that	it	had	“LiSOCl2	NON-RCHRG”	written	on	it.

I	cleaned	the	solar	panels	thoroughly,	then	aimed	a	smal,	flexible	lamp	directly	at
them.	The	battery’s	long	dead.	But	the	panels	might

be	ok,	and	Sojourner	can	operate	directly	off	them.	We’l	see	if	anything	happens.

Then	it	was	time	to	take	a	look	at	Sojourner’s	daddy.	I	suited	up	and	headed	out.

On	most	landers,	the	weak	point	is	the	battery.	It’s	the	most	delicate	component,
and	when	it	dies,	there’s	no	way	to	recover.

Landers	can’t	just	shut	down	and	wait	when	they	have	low	batteries.	Their
electronics	won’t	work	unless	they’re	at	a	minimum

temperature.	So	they	have	heaters	to	keep	the	electronics	warm.	It’s	a	problem
that	rarely	comes	up	on	Earth,	but	hey.	Mars.

Over	time,	the	solar	panels	get	covered	with	dust.	Then	winter	brings	colder
temperatures	and	less	daylight.	This	al	combines	into	a	big

“fuck	you”	from	Mars	to	your	lander.	Eventualy	it’s	using	more	power	to	keep
warm	than	it’s	getting	from	the	meager	daylight	that	makes

it	through	the	dust.

Once	the	battery	runs	down,	the	electronics	get	too	cold	to	operate,	and	the
whole	system	dies.	The	solar	panels	wil	recharge	the

battery	somewhat,	but	there’s	nothing	to	tel	the	system	to	reboot.	Anything	that
could	make	that	decision	would	be	electronics,	which

would	not	be	working.	Eventualy,	the	now	unused	battery	wil	lose	its	ability	to
retain	charge.

That’s	the	usual	cause	of	death.	And	I	sure	hope	it’s	what	kiled	Pathfinder.

I	piled	some	leftover	parts	of	the	MDV	into	a	makeshift	table	and	ramp.	Then	I
dragged	the	Lander	up	to	my	new	outdoor	workbench.

Working	in	an	EVA	suit	is	annoying	enough.	Bending	over	the	whole	time	would

have	been	torture.

I	got	my	toolkit	and	started	poking	around.	Opening	the	outer	panel	wasn’t	too
hard	and	I	identified	the	battery	easily	enough.	JPL

labels	everything.	It’s	a	40	Amp-hour	Ag-Zr	battery	with	an	optimal	voltage	of
1.5V.	Wow.	They	realy	made	those	things	run	on	nothin’

back	then.

I	detached	the	battery	and	headed	back	inside.	I	checked	it	with	my	electronics
kit,	and	sure	enough	it’s	dead,	dead,	dead.	I	could

shuffle	across	a	carpet	and	hold	more	charge.

So	I	knew	what	it	needed.	1.5	volts.

Compared	to	the	makeshift	crap	I’ve	been	gluing	together	since	Sol	6,	this	was	a
breeze.	I	have	voltage	controlers	in	my	kit!	It	only

took	me	15	minutes	to	put	a	controler	on	a	reserve	power	line,	then	another	hour
to	go	outside	and	run	the	line	to	where	the	battery	used	to	be.

Then	there’s	the	issue	of	heat.	It’s	a	good	idea	to	keep	electronics	above	-40C.
The	temperature	today	is	a	brisk	-63C.

The	battery	was	big	and	easy	to	identify,	but	I	had	no	clue	where	the	heaters
were.	Even	if	I	knew,	it’d	be	too	risky	to	hook	them

directly	to	power.	I	could	easily	fry	the	whole	system.

So	instead,	I	went	to	good	old	“Spare	Parts”	Rover	1,	and	stole	it’s	environment
heater.	I’ve	gutted	that	poor	rover	so	much,	it	looks

like	I	parked	it	in	a	bad	part	of	town.

Bringing	the	heater	to	my	“workbench,”	I	hooked	it	to	Hab	power.	Then	I	rested
it	in	the	Lander	where	the	battery	used	to	be.

Now	I	wait.	And	hope.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	96

I	was	realy	hoping	I’d	wake	up	to	a	functional	Lander,	but	no	such	luck.	Its	high-
gain	antenna	is	right	where	I	last	saw	it.	Why	does

that	matter?	Wel,	I’l	tel	ya…

If	the	Lander	comes	back	to	life	(and	that’s	a	big	if)	it’l	try	to	establish	contact
with	Earth.	Problem	is,	nobody’s	listening.	It’s	not	like	the	Pathfinder	team	is
hanging	around	JPL	just	in	case	their	long	dead	probe	is	repaired	by	a	wayward
astronaut.

The	Deep	Space	Network	and	SETI	are	my	best	bets	for	picking	up	the	signal.	If
either	of	them	caught	a	blip	from	Pathfinder,	they’d

tel	JPL.

JPL	would	quickly	figure	out	what	was	going	on,	especialy	when	they
triangulated	the	signal	to	my	landing	site.

They’d	tel	the	Lander	where	Earth	is,	and	it	would	angle	the	high-gain	antenna
appropriately.	That	there,	the	angling	of	the	antenna,	is	how	I’l	know	if	it	linked
up.

So	far,	no	action.

There’s	stil	hope.	Any	number	of	reasons	could	be	delaying	things.	The	rover
heater	is	designed	to	heat	air	at	1	atmosphere.	The	thin

Martian	air	severely	hampers	its	ability	to	work.	So	the	electronics	might	need
more	time	to	warm	up.

Also,	Earth	is	only	visible	during	the	day.	I	(hopefuly)	fixed	the	Lander
yesterday	evening.	It’s	morning	now,	so	most	of	the	intervening	time	has	been
night.	No	Earth.

Sojourner’s	also	showing	no	signs	of	life.	It’s	been	in	the	nice,	warm
environment	of	the	Hab	al	night,	with	plenty	of	light	on	its

sparkling	clean	solar	cels.	Maybe	it’s	running	an	extended	self-check,	or	staying

stil	until	it	hears	from	the	Lander	or	something.

I’l	just	have	to	put	it	out	of	my	mind	for	now.

“Something’s	coming	in…	yes…	yes!	It’s	Pathfinder!”

The	room	burst	in	to	applause	and	cheers.	Venkat	slapped	an	unknown
technician	heartily	on	the	back	while	Bruce	pumped	his	fist	in

the	air.

The	ad-hoc	control	center	was	an	accomplishment	in	itself.	JPL	had	just	20	days
to	piece	together	antiquated	computers,	repair	broken

components,	network	everything,	and	instal	hastily	made	software	to	interact
with	the	modern	Deep	Space	Network.	A	team	of	engineers

had	worked	around	the	clock,	finishing	only	two	days	earlier.

The	room	itself	was	formerly	a	conference	room;	JPL	had	no	space	ready	for	the
sudden	need.	Crammed	with	computers	and

equipment,	little	space	was	left	over	for	the	many	spectators	squeezing	in.

One	Associated	Press	camera	team	was	permitted.	The	rest	of	the	media	would
have	to	satisfy	themselves	with	the	live	AP	feed,	and

await	a	press	conference.

Venkat	turned	to	Bruce.	“God	damn,	Bruce.	You	realy	puled	a	rabbit	out	of	your
hat	this	time!	Good	work!”

“I’m	just	the	director,”	Bruce	said	modestly.	“Thank	the	guys	who	got	al	this	shit
working.”

“Oh	I	wil!”	Venkat	beamed.	“But	first	I	have	to	talk	to	my	new	best	friend!”

Turning	to	the	headsetted	man	at	the	communications	console,	Venkat	asked
“What’s	you’re	name,	new	best	friend?”

“Tim,”	he	said,	not	taking	his	eyes	off	the	screen.

“What	now?”	Venkat	asked.

“We	sent	the	return	telemetry	automaticaly.	It’l	get	there	in	just	over	11	minutes.
Once	it	does,	Pathfinder	wil	start	high-gain

transmissions.	So	it’l	be	22	minutes	til	we	hear	from	it	again.”

“Venkat’s	got	a	doctorate	in	physics,	Tim,”	Bruce	said,	“You	don’t	need	to
explain	transmission	time	to	him.”

Tim	shrugged.	“You	can	never	tel	with	managers.”

“What	was	in	the	transmission	we	got?”	Venkat	asked.

“Just	the	bare	bones.	A	hardware	self	check.	It’s	got	a	lot	of	“nonfunctional”
systems,	cause	they	were	on	the	panels	Watney

removed.”

“What	about	the	camera?”

“It	says	the	imager’s	working.	We’l	have	it	take	a	panorama	as	soon	as	we	can.”

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	97

It	worked!

Holy	fucking	shit	it	worked!

I	just	checked	the	Lander.	The	high	gain	antenna	is	angled	directly	at	Earth!
Pathfinder	has	no	way	of	knowing	where	it	is,	so	it	has	no	way	of	knowing
where	Earth	is.	The	only	way	for	it	to	find	out	is	getting	a	signal.

They	know	I’m	alive!

Happy	dance,	happy	dance,	I’m	doin’	the	happy	dance!

Al	right.	Enough	happy	dance.	Time	to	make	with	the	communicatin’!

“We	received	the	high-gain	response	just	over	half	an	hour	ago,”	Venkat	said	to
the	assembled	press.	“We	immediately	directed

Pathfinder	to	take	a	panoramic	image.	Hopefuly,	Watney	has	some	kind	of
message	for	us.	Questions?”

The	sea	of	reporters	raised	their	hands.

“Cathy,	let’s	start	with	you,”	Venkat	said,	pointing	her	out.

“Thanks,”	she	said.	“Have	you	had	any	contact	with	the	Sojourner	rover?”

“Unfortunately,	no,”	he	replied.	“The	Lander	hasn’t	been	able	to	connect	to
Sojourner,	and	we	have	no	way	to	contact	it	directly.”

“What	might	be	wrong	with	Sojourner?”

“I	can’t	even	speculate,”	Venkat	said.	“After	spending	that	long	on	Mars,
anything	could	be	wrong	with	it.”

“Best	guess?”

“Our	best	guess	is	he	took	it	in	to	the	Hab.	The	Lander’s	signal	wouldn’t	be	able
to	reach	Sojourner	through	Hab	canvas.”	Pointing	to

another	reporter,	he	said	“You,	there.”

“Marty	West,	NBC	News,”	Marty	said.	“How	wil	you	communicate	with
Watney	once	everything’s	up	and	running?”

“That’l	be	up	to	Watney,”	said	Venkat.	“Al	we	have	to	work	with	is	the	camera.
He	can	write	notes	and	hold	them	up.	But	how	we

talk	back	is	trickier.”

“How	so?”	Marty	asked.

“Because	al	we	have	is	the	camera	platform.	That’s	the	only	moving	part.	There
are	plenty	of	ways	to	get	information	across	with	just

the	platform’s	rotation,	but	no	way	to	tel	Watney	about	them.	He’l	have	to	come

up	with	something	and	tel	us.	We’l	folow	his	lead.”

Pointing	to	the	next	reporter,	he	said,	“Go	ahead.”

“Jil	Holbrook,	BBC.	With	a	32	minute	round	trip,	and	nothing	but	a	single
rotating	platform	to	talk	with,	it’l	be	a	dreadfuly	slow

conversation,	won’t	it?”

“Yes	it	wil,”	Venkat	confirmed.	“It’s	early	morning	in	Acidalia	Planitia	right
now,	and	just	past	3am	here	in	Pasadena.	We’l	be	here	al

night,	and	that’s	just	for	a	start.	No	more	questions	for	now,	the	panorama	is	due
back	in	a	few	minutes.	We’l	keep	you	posted.”

Quickly	leaving	the	press	room,	Venkat	hurried	down	the	hal	to	the	makeshift
Pathfinder	control	center.	He	pressed	through	the	throng

to	the	communications	console.

“Anything,	Tim?”

“Totaly,”	he	replied.	“But	we’re	staring	at	this	black	screen	because	it’s	way
more	interesting	than	pictures	from	Mars.”

“You’re	a	smart-ass,	Tim,”	Venkat	said.

“Noted.”

Bruce	pushed	his	way	forward.	“Stil	another	few	seconds	on	the	clock,”	he	said.

The	time	passed	in	silence.

“Getting	something,”	Tim	said.	“Yup.	It’s	the	panoramic.”

A	general	loosening	of	tension	coruscated	through	the	room	as	the	image	slowly
came	through,	one	vertical	stripe	at	a	time.

“Martian	surface…”	Venkat	said	as	the	lines	displayed.	“More	surface…”

“Edge	of	the	Hab!”	Bruce	said,	pointing	to	the	screen.

“Hab,”	Venkat	smiled.	“More	Hab	now…	more	Hab…	is	that	a	message?	That’s
a	message!”

The	vertical	stripes	revealed	a	handwritten	note,	suspended	at	the	camera’s
height	by	a	thin	metal	rod.

“We	got	a	note	from	Mark!”	Venkat	announced	to	the	room.

Applause	filed	the	room,	then	quickly	died	down.	“What’s	it	say?”	someone
asked.

Venkat	leaned	closer	to	the	screen.	“It	says	…‘I’l	write	questions	here	–	Are	you
receiving?’”

“Ok…?”	said	Bruce.

“That’s	what	it	says,”	Venkat	shrugged.

“Another	note,”	said	Tim,	pointing	to	the	screen	as	the	slow	march	of	data
revealed	itself.

Venkat	leaned	in	again.	“This	one	says	‘Point	here	for	yes’.”

“Al	right,	I	see	what	he’s	going	for,”	said	Bruce.

“There’s	the	third	note,”	said	Tim.

“‘Point	here	for	no,’”	Venkat	read.	“‘Wil	check	often	for	answer’”

Venkat	folded	his	arms.	“Al	right.	We	have	communication	with	Mark.	Tim,
point	the	camera	at	‘Yes’.	Then,	start	taking	pictures	at

10	minute	intervals	until	he	puts	another	question	up.”

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	97	(2)

“Yes!”	They	said	“Yes!”

I	haven’t	been	this	excited	about	a	“yes”	since	prom	night!

Ok,	calm	down.

I	have	limited	paper	to	work	with.	These	cards	were	intended	to	label	batches	of
samples.	I	have	about	50	cards.	I	can	use	both	sides,

and	if	it	comes	down	to	it,	I	can	re-use	them	by	scratching	out	the	old	question.

The	Sharpie	I’m	using	wil	last	much	longer	than	the	cards,	so	ink	isn’t	a
problem.	But	I	have	to	do	al	my	writing	in	the	Hab.	I	don’t

know	what	kind	of	halucinogenic	crap	that	ink	is	made	of,	but	I’m	pretty	sure	it
would	boil	off	in	1/90th	of	an	atmosphere.

I’m	using	old	parts	of	the	antenna	array	to	hold	the	cards	up.	There’s	a	certain
irony	in	that.

We’l	need	to	talk	faster	than	yes/no	questions	every	half-hour.	The	camera	can
rotate	360	degrees,	and	I	have	plenty	of	antenna	parts.

Time	to	make	an	alphabet.	But	I	can’t	just	use	the	letters	A	through	Z.	With	my
Question	Card,	that	would	be	27	cards	around	the	lander.

Each	one	would	only	get	13	degrees	of	arc.	Even	if	JPL	points	the	camera
perfectly,	there’s	a	good	chance	I	won’t	know	which	letter	they	meant.

So	I’l	have	to	use	ASCII.	That’s	how	computers	manage	characters.	Each
character	has	a	numerical	code	between	0	and	255.	Values

between	0	and	255	can	be	expressed	as	2	hexadecimal	digits.	By	giving	me	pairs
of	hex	digits,	they	can	send	any	character	they	like,

How	do	I	know	which	values	go	with	which	characters?	Because	Johanssen’s
laptop	is	a	wealth	of	information.	I	knew	she’d	have	an

ASCII	table	in	there	somewhere.	Al	computer	geeks	do.

So	I’l	make	cards	for	0	through	9,	and	A	through	F.	That	makes	16	cards	to	place
around	the	camera,	plus	the	Question	Card.	17

cards	means	over	21	degrees	each.	Much	easier	to	deal	with.

“I	was	up	al	night,”	said	Venkat.	“Forgive	me	if	I’m	a	little	punchy.	Who	are	you
again?”

“Jack	Trevor,”	said	the	thin,	pale	man	before	Venkat.	“I	work	in	software
engineering.”

“What	can	I	do	for	you?”

“We	have	an	idea	for	communication.”

“I’m	al	ears.”

“We’ve	been	looking	through	the	old	Pathfinder	software.	We	got	duplicate
computers	up	and	running	for	testing.	Same	computers

they	used	to	find	a	problem	that	almost	kiled	the	original	mission.	Real
interesting	story,	actualy,	turns	out	there	was	a	priority	inversion	in	Sojourner’s
thread	management	and-”

“Focus,	Jack,”	interrupted	Venkat.

“Right.	Wel,	the	thing	is,	Pathfinder	has	an	OS	update	process.	So	we	can
change	the	software	to	anything	we	want.”

“Ok,	how	does	this	help	us?”

“Pathfinder	has	two	communication	systems.	One	to	talk	to	us,	the	other	to	talk
to	Sojourner.	We	can	change	the	second	system	to

broadcast	on	the	Ares-3	rover	frequency.	And	we	can	have	it	pretend	to	be	the
beacon	signal	from	the	Hab.”

“You	can	get	Pathfinder	talking	to	Mark’s	rover?”

“It’s	the	only	option.	The	Hab’s	radio	is	dead.	Thing	is,	al	the	rover	does	is
triangulate	the	signal	to	fix	its	location.	It	doesn’t	send	data	back	to	the	Hab.	It
just	has	a	voice	channel	for	the	astronauts	to	talk	to	each	other.”

“So,”	Venkat	said,	“You	can	get	Pathfinder	talking	to	the	rover,	but	you	can’t	get
the	rover	talking	back.”

“Right.	What	we	want	is	for	our	text	to	show	up	on	the	rover	screen,	and
whatever	Watney	types	to	be	sent	back	to	us.	That	requires	a

change	to	the	rover’s	software.”

“And	we	can’t	do	that,”	Venkat	concluded.	“Because	we	can’t	talk	to	the	rover.”

“Not	directly,”	Jack	said.	“But	we	can	send	data	to	Watney,	and	have	him	enter	it
in	to	the	rover.”

“How	much	data	are	we	talking	about?”

“I	have	guys	working	on	the	rover	software	right	now.	The	patch	file	wil	be	20
Meg,	minimum.	We	can	send	one	byte	to	Watney	every

4	seconds	or	so	with	the	‘Speak&Spel.’	It’d	take	three	years	of	constant
broadcasting	to	get	that	patch	across.	So	that’s	no	good.”

“But	you’re	talking	to	me,	so	you	have	a	solution,	right?”	Venkat	probed.

“Of	course!”	Jack	beamed.	“Software	engineers	are	sneaky	bastards	when	it
comes	to	data	management.”

“Enlighten	me,”	said	Venkat,	patiently.

“Here’s	the	clever	part,”	Jack	said,	conspiratorialy.	“The	rover	currently	parses

the	signal	into	bytes,	then	identifies	the	specific

sequence	the	Hab	sends.	That	way,	natural	radio	waves	won’t	throw	off	the
homing.	If	the	bytes	aren’t	right,	the	rover	ignores	them.”

“Ok,	so	what?”

“It	means	there’s	a	spot	in	the	codebase	where	it’s	got	the	parsed	bytes.	We	can
insert	a	tiny	bit	of	code,	just	20	instructions,	to	write	the	parsed	bytes	to	a	log	file
before	checking	their	validity.”

“This	sounds	promising…”	Venkat	said.

“It	is!”	Jack	said	excitedly.	“First,	we	update	Pathfinder	with	our	replacement
OS.	Then,	we	tel	Watney	exactly	how	to	hack	the	rover

software	to	add	those	20	instructions.	Then	we	broadcast	the	rover’s	patch	to
Pathfinder,	which	re-broadcasts	it	to	the	rover.	The	rover	logs	the	bytes	to	a	file.
Finaly,	Watney	launches	the	file	as	an	executable	and	it	patches	the	rover
software!”

Venkat	furrowed	his	brow,	taking	in	far	more	information	than	his	sleep-
deprived	mind	wanted	to	accept.

“Um,”	Jack	said.	“You’re	not	cheering	or	dancing.”

“So	we	just	need	to	send	Watney	those	20	instructions?”	Venkat	asked.

“That,	and	how	to	edit	the	files.	And	where	to	insert	the	instructions	in	the	files.”

“Just	like	that?”

“Just	like	that!”

Venkat	was	silent	for	a	moment.	“Jack.	I’m	going	to	buy	your	whole	team
autographed	Star	Trek	memorabilia.”

“I	prefer	Star	Wars.”

“Helo?”

“I	need	a	picture	of	Watney.”

“Hi,	Annie.	Nice	to	hear	from	you,	too.	How	are	things	back	in	Houston?”

“Cut	the	shit,	Venkat.	I	need	a	picture.”

“It’s	not	that	simple,”	Venkat	explained.

“You’re	talking	to	him	with	a	fucking	camera.	How	hard	can	it	be?”

“We	spel	out	our	message,	wait	20	minutes	and	then	take	a	picture.	Watney’s
back	in	the	Hab	by	then.”

“So	tel	him	to	be	around	when	you	take	the	next	picture,”	Annie	demanded.

“We	can	only	send	one	message	per	hour,	and	only	when	Acidalia	Planitia	is
facing	Earth,”	Venkat	said.	“We’re	not	going	to	waste	a

message	just	to	tel	him	to	pose	for	a	photo.	Besides,	he’l	be	in	his	EVA	suit.	You
won’t	even	be	able	to	see	his	face.”

“I	need	something,	Venkat,”	Annie	said.	“You’ve	been	in	contact	for	24	hours
and	the	media	is	going	ape	shit.	They	want	an	image	for

the	story.	It’l	be	on	every	news	site	in	the	world.”

“You	have	the	pictures	of	his	notes.	Make	do	with	that.”

“Not	enough,”	Annie	said.	“The	press	is	crawling	down	my	throat	for	this.	And
up	my	ass.	Both	directions,	Venkat!	They’re	gonna

meet	in	the	middle!”

“It’l	have	to	wait	a	few	days.	We’re	going	to	try	and	link	Pathfinder	to	the	rover
computer-“

“A	few	days!?”	Annie	gasped.	“This	is	al	anyone	cares	about	right	now.	In	the
world.	You	see	what	I’m	getting	at?	This	is	the	biggest

story	since	Apolo	13.	Give	me	a	fucking	picture!”

Venkat	sighed.	“I’l	try	to	get	it	tomorrow.”

“Great!”	She	said.	“Looking	forward	to	it.”

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	98

I	have	to	be	watching	the	camera	when	it	spels	shit	out.	It’s	half	a	byte	at	a	time.
So	I	watch	a	pair	of	numbers,	then	look	them	up	on

an	ASCII	cheat-sheet	I	made.	That’s	one	letter.

I	don’t	want	to	forget	any	letters,	so	I	scrape	them	in	to	the	dirt	with	a	rod.	The
process	of	looking	up	a	letter	and	scraping	it	in	the	dirt	takes	a	couple	of
seconds.	Sometimes	when	I	look	back	at	the	camera,	I’ve	missed	a	number.	I	can
usualy	guess	it	from	context,	but	other	times	I	just	miss	out.

Today	I	got	up	hours	earlier	than	I	needed	to.	It	was	like	Christmas	morning!	I
could	hardly	wait	for	08:00	to	rol	around.	I	had

breakfast,	did	some	unnecessary	checks	on	Hab	equipment,	and	read	some
Poirot.	Finaly	the	time	came!

“CNHAKRVR2TLK2PTHFDRPRP4LONGMSG”

Yeah.	Took	me	a	minute.	“Can	hack	rover	to	talk	to	Pathfinder.	Prepare	for	long
message.”

That	took	some	mental	gymnastics	to	work	out.	But	it	was	great	news!	If	we
could	get	that	set	up,	we’d	only	be	limited	by	transmission

time!	I	set	up	a	note	that	said	“Roger.”

Not	sure	what	they	meant	by	“long	message”	but	I	figured	I	better	be	ready.	I
went	out	15	minutes	before	the	top	of	the	hour	and

smoothed	out	a	big	area	of	dirt.	I	found	the	longest	antenna	rod	I	had,	so	I	could
reach	in	to	the	smooth	area	without	having	to	step	on	it.

Then	I	stood	by.	Waiting.

At	exactly	the	top	of	the	hour,	the	message	came.

“LNCHhexiditONRVRCMP,OPENFILE-/usr/lib/habcomm.so-
SCROLLTILIDXON

LFTIS:2AAE5,OVRWRT141BYTSWTHDATAWE’LLSNDNXTMSG,STANDINVIE
W4NXTPIC20MINFTERTHSDONE”

Jesus.	Ok…

They	want	me	to	launch	‘hexedit’	on	the	rover’s	computer,	then	open	the	file
/usr/lib/habcomm.so,	scrol	until	the	index	reading	on	the

left	of	the	screen	is	2AAE5,	then	replace	the	bytes	there	with	a	141	byte
sequence	NASA	wil	send	in	the	next	message.	Fair	enough.

Also,	for	some	reason,	they	want	me	to	hang	around	for	the	next	pic.	Not	sure
why.	You	can’t	see	any	part	of	me	when	I’m	in	the	suit.

Even	the	faceplate	would	reflect	too	much	light.	Stil,	it’s	what	they	want.

I	went	back	in	and	copied	down	the	message	for	future	reference.	Then	I	wrote	a
short	note	and	came	back	out.	Usualy	I’d	pin	up	the

note	and	go	back	in.	But	this	time	I	had	to	hang	around	for	a	photo	op.

I	gave	the	camera	a	thumb’s-up	to	go	along	with	my	note,	which	said
“Ayyyyyy!”

Blame	the	‘70’s	TV.

“I	ask	for	a	picture	and	I	get	The	Fonz?”	Annie	admonished.

“You	got	your	picture,	quit	bitching,”	Venkat	said,	cradling	the	phone	on	his
shoulder.	He	paid	more	attention	to	the	schematics	in	front	of	him	than	the
conversation.

“Ayyyyyy!”	Annie	mocked.	“Why	would	he	do	that?”

“Have	you	met	Mark	Watney?”

“Fine,	fine,”	Annie	said.	“But	I	want	a	pic	of	his	face	ASAP.”

“Can’t	do	that.”

“Why	not?”

“Because	if	he	takes	off	his	helmet,	he’l	die.	Annie,	I	have	to	go,	one	of	the	JPL
programmers	is	here	and	it’s	urgent.	Bye!”

“But-“	Annie	said	as	he	hung	up.

Jack,	in	the	doorway,	said	“It’s	not	urgent.”

“Yeah,	I	know,”	Venkat	said.	“What	can	I	do	for	you?”

“We	were	thinking,”	Jack	began,	“This	rover	hack	might	get	kind	of	detailed.	We
may	have	to	do	a	bunch	of	back-and-forth

communication	with	Watney.”

“That’s	fine,”	Venkat	said.	“Take	your	time,	do	it	right.”

“We	could	get	things	done	faster	with	a	shorter	transmission	time,”	Jack	said.

Venkat	gave	him	a	puzzled	look.	“Do	you	have	a	plan	for	moving	Earth	and
Mars	closer	together?”

“Earth	doesn’t	have	to	be	involved,”	Jack	said.	“Hermes	is	73	milion	km	from
Mars	right	now.	Only	4	light-minutes	away.	Beth

Johanssen	is	a	great	programmer.	She	could	talk	Mark	through	it.”

“Out	of	the	question,”	Venkat	said.

“She’s	the	mission	Sysop,”	Jack	pressed	on,	“This	is	her	exact	area	of	expertise.”

“Can’t	do	it,	Jack.	The	crew	stil	doesn’t	know.”

“What	is	with	you?	Why	won’t	you	just	tel	them?”

“Watney’s	not	my	only	responsibility,”	Venkat	said.	“I’ve	got	five	other
astronauts	in	deep	space,	who	have	to	concentrate	on	their

return	trip.	Nobody	thinks	about	it,	but	statisticaly	they’re	in	more	danger	than
Watney	right	now.	He’s	on	a	planet.	They’re	in	space.”

Jack	raised	his	arms.	“Fine,	we’l	do	it	the	slow	way.”

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	98	(2)

Ever	transcribed	141	random	bytes,	one	half	of	a	byte	at	a	time?

It’s	boring.	And	it’s	tricky	when	you	don’t	have	a	pen.

Earlier,	I	had	just	written	letters	in	the	sand.	But	this	time,	I	needed	a	way	to	get
the	numbers	on	to	something	portable.	My	first	plan	was:	Use	a	laptop!

Each	crewman	had	their	own	laptop.	So	I	have	six	at	my	disposal.	Rather,	I
“had”	six.	I	now	have	five.	I	thought	a	laptop	would	be	fine

outside.	It’s	just	electronics,	right?	It’l	keep	warm	enough	to	operate	in	the	short
term,	and	it	doesn’t	need	air	for	anything.

It	died	instantly.	The	screen	went	black	before	I	was	out	of	the	airlock.	Turns	out
the	“L”	in	“LCD”	stands	for	“Liquid.”	I	guess	it	either	froze	or	boiled	off.
Maybe	I’l	post	a	consumer	review.	“Brought	product	to	surface	of	Mars.	It
stopped	working.	0/10.”

So	I	used	a	camera.	I’ve	got	lots	of	them,	specialy	made	for	working	on	Mars.	I
wrote	the	bytes	in	the	sand	as	they	came	in,	took	a

picture,	then	transcribed	them	in	the	Hab.

It’s	night	now,	so	no	more	messages.	Tomorrow,	I’l	enter	this	in	to	the	rover	and
the	geeks	at	JPL	can	take	it	from	there.

“Come	on	up	here,	Jack,”	said	Venkat.	“You	get	to	be	the	most	Timward	today.”

“Thanks,”	said	Jack,	taking	Venkat’s	place	next	to	Tim.	“Heya,	Tim!”

“Jack,”	said	Tim.

“How	long	wil	the	patch	take?”	Venkat	asked.

“Should	be	pretty	much	instant,”	Jack	answered.	“Watney	entered	the	hack
earlier	today,	and	we	confirmed	it	worked.	We	updated

Pathfinder’s	OS	without	any	problems.	We	sent	the	rover	patch,	which
Pathfinder	rebroadcast.	Once	Watney	executes	the	patch	and

reboots	the	rover,	we	should	get	a	connection.”

“Jesus	what	a	complicated	process,”	Venkat	said.

“Try	updating	a	Linux	server	some	time,”	Jack	said.

After	a	moment	of	silence,	Tim	said	“You	know	he	was	teling	a	joke,	right?	That
was	supposed	to	be	funny.”

“Oh,”	said	Venkat.	“I’m	a	physics	guy,	not	a	computer	guy.”

“He’s	not	funny	to	computer	guys	either.”

“You’re	a	very	unpleasant	man,	Tim,”	Jack	said.

“System’s	online,”	said	Tim.

“What?”

“It’s	online.	FYI.”

“Holy	crap!”	Jack	said.

“It	worked!”	Venkat	announced	to	the	room.

[11:18]JPL:	Mark,	this	is	Venkat	Kapoor.	We’ve	been	watching	you	since	Sol
49.

The	whole	world’s	been	rooting	for	you.	Amazing	job,	getting	Pathfinder.	We’re

working	on	rescue	plans.	JPL	is	adjusting	Ares	4’s	MDV	to	do	a	short	overland

flight.	They’ll	pick	you	up,	then	take	you	with	them	to	Schiaparelli.	We’re
putting

together	a	supply	mission	to	keep	you	fed	till	Ares	4	arrives.

[11:29]WATNEY:	Glad	to	hear	it.	Really	looking	forward	to	not	dying.	I	want	to

make	it	clear	it	wasn’t	the	crew’s	fault.	Side	question:	What	did	they	say	when

they	found	out	I	was	alive?	Also,	“Hi,	mom!”

[11:41]JPL:	Tell	us	about	your	“crops”.	We	estimated	your	food	packs	would	last

until	Sol	400	at	3/4	ration	per	meal.	Will	your	crops	affect	that	number?	As	to

your	question:	We	haven’t	told	the	crew	you’re	alive	yet.	We	wanted	them	to

concentrate	on	their	own	mission.

[11:52]WATNEY:	The	crops	are	potatoes,	grown	from	the	ones	we	were
supposed	to

prepare	on	Thanksgiving.	They’re	doing	great,	but	the	available	farmland	isn’t

enough	for	sustainability.	I’ll	run	out	food	around	Sol	900.	Also:	Tell	the	crew

I’m	alive!	What	the	fuck	is	wrong	with	you?

[12:04]JPL:	We’ll	get	botanists	in	to	ask	detailed	questions	and	double-check

your	work.	Your	life	is	at	stake,	so	we	want	to	be	sure.	Sol	900	is	great	news.

It’ll	give	us	a	lot	more	time	to	get	the	supply	mission	together.	Also,	please

watch	your	language.	Everything	you	type	is	being	broadcast	live	all	over	the

world.

[12:15]WATNEY:	Look!	A	pair	of	boobs!	->	(.Y.)

“Thank	you,	Mr.	President,”	Teddy	said	in	to	the	phone.	“I	appreciate	the	cal,
and	I’l	pass	your	congratulations	on	to	the	whole

organization.”

Hanging	up,	he	saw	Mitch	Henderson	in	the	doorway.

“This	a	good	time?”	Mitch	asked.

“Come	in,	Mitch,”	Teddy	said.	“Have	a	seat.”

“Thanks,”	Mitch	said,	sitting	in	a	fine	leather	couch.	“Good	day	today!”

“Yes,	it	was,”	Teddy	agreed.	“Another	step	closer	to	getting	Watney	back	alive.”

“Yeah,	about	that,”	said	Mitch.	“You	probably	know	why	I’m	here.”

“I	can	take	a	guess,”	said	Teddy.	“You	want	to	tel	the	crew	Watney’s	alive.”

“Yes,”	Mitch	said.

“And	you’re	bringing	this	up	with	me	while	Venkat	is	in	Pasadena,	so	he	can’t
argue	the	other	side.”

“I	shouldn’t	have	to	clear	this	with	you	or	Venkat	or	anyone	else.	I’m	the	flight
director.	It	should	have	been	my	cal	from	the	beginning,	but	you	two	stepped	in
and	overrode	me.	Ignoring	al	that,	we	agreed	we’d	tel	them	when	there	was
hope.	And	now	there’s	hope.	We’ve

got	communication,	we	have	a	plan	for	rescue	in	the	works,	and	his	farm	buys	us
enough	time	to	get	him	supplies.”

“Ok,	tel	them.”	Teddy	said.

Mitch	paused.	“Just	like	that?”

“I	knew	you’d	be	here	sooner	or	later,	so	I	already	thought	it	through	and
decided.	Go	ahead	and	tel	them.”

Mitch	stood	up.	“Al	right.	Thanks,”	he	said	as	he	left	the	office.

Teddy	swiveled	in	his	chair	and	looked	out	his	windows	to	the	night	sky.	He
pondered	the	faint,	red	dot	amongst	the	stars.	“Hang	in

there	Watney,”	he	said	to	no	one.	“We’re	coming.”

Chapter	12

Watney	slept	peacefuly	in	his	bunk.	He	shifted	slightly	as	some	pleasant	dream
put	a	smile	on	his	face.	The	previous	day	had	been

particularly	labor-intensive,	so	he	slept	deeper	and	better	than	he	had	in	a	long
time.

“Good	morning	crew!”	Lewis	caled	out.	“It’s	a	brand	new	day!	Up	and	at	‘em!”

Watney	added	his	voice	to	a	chorus	of	groans.

“Come	on,”	Lewis	prodded,	“no	bitching.	You	got	40	minutes	more	sleep	than
you	would’ve	on	Earth.”

Martinez	was	first	out	of	his	bunk.	An	Air-Force	man,	he	could	match	Lewis’s
Navy	schedule	with	ease.	“Morning,	Commander,”	he

said	crisply.

Johanssen	sat	up,	but	made	no	further	move	toward	the	harsh	world	outside	her
blankets.	A	career	software-engineer,	mornings	were

never	her	forte.

Vogel	slowly	lumbered	from	his	bunk,	checking	his	watch.	He	wordlessly	puled
on	his	jumpsuit,	smoothing	out	what	wrinkles	he	could.

He	sighed	inwardly	at	the	grimy	feeling	of	another	day	without	a	shower.

Watney	turned	away	from	the	noise,	hugging	a	pilow	to	his	head.	“Noisy	people
go	away,”	he	mumbled.

“Beck!”	Martinez	caled	out,	shaking	the	mission’s	doctor.	“Rise	and	shine,	bud!”

“Yeah,	ok,”	Beck	said	blearily.

Johanssen	fel	out	of	her	bunk,	then	remained	on	the	floor.

Puling	the	pilow	from	Watney’s	hands,	Lewis	said	“Let’s	move,	Watney!	Uncle
Sam	paid	$100,000	for	every	second	we’l	be	here.”

“Bad	woman	take	pilow,”	Watney	groaned,	unwiling	to	open	his	eyes.

“Back	on	Earth,	I’ve	tipped	200-pound	men	out	of	their	bunks.	Want	to	see	what
I	can	do	in	0.4g?”

“No,	not	realy,”	Watney	said,	sitting	up.

Having	rousted	the	troops,	Lewis	sat	at	the	comm	station	to	check	overnight
messages	from	Houston.

Watney	shuffled	to	the	ration	cupboard	and	grabbed	a	breakfast	at	random.

“Hand	me	an	‘eggs’,	wil	ya,”	Martinez	said.

“You	can	tel	the	difference?”	Watney	said,	passing	Martinez	a	pack.

“Not	realy,”	Martinez	said.

“Beck,	what’l	you	have?”	Watney	continued.

“Don’t	care,”	Beck	said.	“Give	me	whatever.”

Watney	tossed	a	pack	to	him.

“Vogel,	your	usual	sausages?”

“Ja,	please,”	Vogel	responded.

“You	know	you’re	a	stereotype,	right?”

“I	am	comfortable	with	that,”	Vogel	replied,	taking	the	proffered	breakfast.

“Hey	Sunshine,”	Watney	caled	to	Johanssen.	“Eating	breakfast	today?”

“Mnrrn,”	Johanssen	grunted.

“Pretty	sure	that’s	a	no,”	Watney	guessed.

The	crew	ate	in	silence.	Johanssen	eventualy	trudged	to	the	ration	cupboard	and
got	a	coffee	packet.	Clumsily	adding	hot	water,	she

sipped	it	until	wakefulness	crept	in.

“Mission	updates	from	Houston,”	Lewis	said.	“Satelites	show	a	storm	coming,
but	we	can	do	surface	ops	before	it	gets	here.	Vogel,

Martinez,	you’l	be	with	me	outside.	Johanssen,	you’re	stuck	tracking	weather
reports.	Watney,	your	soil	experiments	are	bumped	up	to

today.	Beck,	run	the	samples	from	yesterday’s	EVA	through	the	spectrometer.”

“Should	you	realy	go	out	with	a	storm	on	the	way?”	Beck	asked.

“Houston	authorized	it,”	Lewis	said.

“Seems	needlessly	dangerous.”

“Coming	to	Mars	was	needlessly	dangerous,”	Lewis	said.	“What’s	your	point?”

Beck	shrugged.	“Just	be	careful.”

Three	figures	looked	eastward.	Their	bulky	EVA	suits	rendered	them	nearly
identical.	Only	the	European	Union	flag	on	Vogel’s

shoulder	distinguished	him	from	Lewis	and	Martinez,	who	donned	the	Stars	and
Stripes.

The	darkness	to	the	east	undulated	and	flickered	in	the	rays	of	the	rising	sun.

“The	storm.”	Vogel	said	in	his	accented	English.	“It	is	closer	than	Houston
reported.”

“We’ve	got	time,”	Lewis	said.	“Focus	on	the	task	at	hand.	This	EVA’s	al	about
chemical	analysis.	Vogel,	you’re	the	chemist,	so

you’re	in	charge	of	what	we	dig	up.”

“Ja,”	Vogel	said.	“Please	dig	30	centimeters	and	get	soil	samples.	At	least	100
grams	each.	Very	important	is	30	centimeters	down.”

“Wil	do.”	Lewis	said.	“Stay	within	100	meters	of	the	Hab,”	she	added.

“Mm,”	Vogel	said.

“Yes,	Ma’am,”	said	Martinez.

They	split	up.	Greatly	improved	since	the	days	of	Apolo,	Ares	EVA	suits	alowed
much	more	freedom	of	motion.	Digging,	bending

over,	and	bagging	samples	were	trivial	tasks.

After	a	time,	Lewis	asked	“How	many	samples	do	you	need?”

“Seven	each,	perhaps?”

“That’s	fine,”	Lewis	confirmed.	“I’ve	got	four	so	far.”

“Five	here,”	Martinez	said.	“Of	course,	we	can’t	expect	the	Navy	to	keep	up
with	the	Air	Force,	now	can	we?”

“So	that’s	how	you	want	to	play	it?”	Lewis	said.

“Just	cal	‘em	as	I	see	‘em	Commander.”

“Johanssen	here,”	came	the	sysop’s	voice	over	the	radio.	“Houston’s	upgraded
the	storm	to	‘severe’.	It’s	going	to	be	here	in	15

minutes.”

“Back	to	base,”	Lewis	said.

The	Hab	shook	in	the	roaring	wind	as	the	astronauts	huddled	in	the	center.	Al	six
of	donned	their	EVA	suits	in	case	of	a	breach.

Johanssen	watched	her	laptop	while	the	rest	watched	her.

“Sustained	winds	over	100kph	now,”	she	said.	“Gusting	to	125.”

“Jesus,	we’re	gonna	end	up	in	Oz,”	Watney	said.	“What’s	the	abort	windspeed?”

“Technicaly	150kph,”	Martinez	said.	“Any	more	than	that	and	the	MAV’s	in

danger	of	tipping.”

“Any	predictions	on	the	storm	track?”	Lewis	asked.

“This	is	the	edge	of	it,”	Johanssen	said,	staring	at	her	screen.	“It’s	gonna	get
worse	before	it	gets	better.”

The	Hab	canvas	rippled	under	the	brutal	assault	as	the	internal	supports	bent	and
shivered	with	each	gust.	The	cacophony	grew	louder

by	the	minute.

“Al	right,”	Lewis	said.	“Prep	for	abort.	We’l	go	to	the	MAV	and	hope	for	the
best.	If	the	wind	gets	too	high,	we’l	launch.”

Leaving	the	Hab	in	pairs,	they	grouped	up	outside	airlock	1.	The	driving	wind
and	sand	battered	them,	but	they	were	able	to	stay	on

their	feet.

“Visibility	is	almost	zero,”	Lewis	said.	“If	you	get	lost,	home	in	on	my	suit’s
telemetry.	The	wind’s	gonna	be	rougher	away	from	the

Hab,	so	be	ready.”

Pressing	through	the	gale,	they	stumbled	toward	the	MAV.

“Hey,”	Watney	panted,	“Maybe	we	could	shore	up	the	MAV.	Make	tipping	less
likely.”

“How?”	Lewis	huffed.

“We	could	use	cables	from	the	solar	farm	as	guy	lines.”	He	wheezed	for	a	few
moments,	then	continued.	“The	rovers	could	be	anchors.

The	trick	would	be	getting	the	line	around	the-“

Flying	wreckage	slammed	Watney,	carrying	him	off	in	to	the	wind.

“Watney!”	Johanssen	exclaimed.

“What	happened?”	Lewis	said.

“Something	hit	him!”	Johanssen	reported.

“Watney,	report,”	Lewis	said.

No	reply.

“Watney,	report,”	Lewis	repeated.

Again,	she	was	met	with	silence.

“He’s	offline,”	Johanssen	reported.	“I	don’t	know	where	he	is!”

“Commander,”	Beck	said,	“Before	we	lost	telemetry,	his	decompression	alarm
went	off!”

“Shit!”	Lewis	exclaimed.	“Johanssen	where	did	you	last	see	him?”

“He	was	right	in	front	of	me	and	then	he	was	gone,”	she	said.	“He	flew	off	due
west.”

“Ok,”	Lewis	said.	“Martinez,	get	to	the	MAV	and	prep	for	launch.	Everyone
else,	home	in	on	Johanssen.”

“Doctor	Beck,”	Vogel	said	as	he	stumbled	through	the	storm,	“How	long	can	a
person	survive	decompression?”

“Less	than	a	minute,”	Beck	said,	emotion	choking	his	voice.

“I	can’t	see	anything,”	Johanssen	said	as	the	crew	crowded	around	her.

“Line	up	and	walk	west,”	Lewis	commanded.	“Smal	steps.	He’s	probably	prone;
we	don’t	want	to	step	over	him.”

Staying	in	sight	of	one	another,	they	trudged	through	the	chaos.

Martinez	fel	in	to	the	MAV	airlock	and	forced	it	closed	against	the	wind.	Once	it
pressurized	he	quickly	doffed	his	suit.	Climbing	the

ladder	to	the	crew	compartment,	he	slid	in	to	the	pilot’s	couch	and	booted	the

system.

Grabbing	the	emergency-launch	checklist	with	one	hand,	he	flicked	switches
rapidly	with	the	other.	One	by	one,	the	systems	reported

flight-ready	status.	As	they	came	online,	he	noted	one	in	particular.

“Commander,”	he	radioed,	“The	MAV’s	got	a	7	degree	tilt.	It’l	tip	at	12.3.”

“Copy	that,”	Lewis	said.

“Johanssen,”	Beck	said,	looking	at	his	arm	computer,	“Watney’s	bio-monitor
sent	something	before	going	offline.	My	computer	just

says	‘Bad	Packet.’”

“I	have	it,	too,”	Johanssen	said.	“It	didn’t	finish	transmitting.	Some	data’s
missing	and	there’s	no	checksum.	Gimme	a	sec.”

“Commander,”	Martinez	said.	“Message	from	Houston.	We’re	officialy
scrubbed.	The	storm’s	definitely	gonna	be	too	rough.”

“Copy,”	Lewis	said.

“They	sent	that	four	and	a	half	minutes	ago,”	Martinez	continued,	“while
looking	at	satelite	data	from	nine	minutes	ago.”

“Understood,”	Lewis	said.	“Continue	prepping	for	launch.”

“Copy,”	Martinez	said.

“Beck,”	Johanssen	said.	“I	have	the	raw	packet.	It’s	plaintext:	BP	0,	PR	0,	TP
36.2.	That’s	as	far	as	it	got.”

“Copy,”	Beck	said	morosely.	“Blood	pressure	0,	pulse	rate	0,	temperature
normal.”

The	channel	fel	silent	for	some	time.	They	continued	pressing	forward,	shuffling
through	the	sandstorm,	hoping	for	a	miracle.

“Temperature	normal?”	Lewis	said,	a	hint	of	hope	in	her	voice.

“It	takes	a	while	for	the-“	Beck	stammered.	“It	takes	a	while	to	cool.”

“Commander,”	Martinez	said.	“Tilting	at	10.5	degrees	now,	with	gusts	pushing	it
to	11.”

“Copy,”	Lewis	said.	“Are	you	at	pilot-release?”

“Affirmative,”	Martinez	replied.	“I	can	launch	any	time.”

“If	it	tips,	can	you	launch	before	it	fals	completely	over?”

“Uh,”	Martinez	said,	not	expecting	the	question.	“Yes	Ma’am.	I’d	take	manual
control	and	go	ful	throttle.	Then	I’d	nose	up	and	return

to	pre-programmed	ascent.”

“Copy	that,”	Lewis	said.	“Everyone	home	in	on	Martinez’s	suit.	That’l	get	you
to	the	MAV	airlock.	Get	in	and	prep	for	launch.”

“What	about	you,	Commander?”	Beck	asked.

“I’m	searching	a	little	more.	Get	moving.	And	Martinez,	if	you	start	to	tip,
launch.”

“You	realy	think	I’l	leave	you	behind?”	Martinez	said.

“I	just	ordered	you	to,”	Lewis	replied.	“You	three,	get	to	the	ship.”

They	reluctantly	obeyed	Lewis’s	order,	and	made	their	way	toward	the	MAV.
The	punishing	wind	fought	them	every	step	of	the	way.

Unable	to	see	the	ground,	Lewis	shuffled	forward.	Remembering	something,	she
reached	to	her	back	and	got	a	pair	of	rock-dril	bits.

She	had	added	the	1-meter	bits	to	her	equipment	that	morning,	anticipating
geological	sampling	later	in	the	day.	Holding	one	in	each	hand,	she	dragged
them	along	the	ground	as	she	walked.

After	20	meters,	she	turned	around	and	walked	the	opposite	direction.	Walking	a
straight	line	proved	to	be	impossible.	Not	only	did

she	lack	visual	references,	the	endless	wind	pushed	her	off	course.	The	sheer
volume	of	attacking	sand	buried	her	feet	with	each	step.

Grunting,	she	pressed	on.

Beck,	Johanssen,	and	Vogel	squeezed	in	to	the	MAV	airlock.	Designed	for	two,
it	could	be	used	by	three	in	emergencies.	As	it

equalized,	Lewis’s	voice	came	over	the	radio.

“Johanssen,”	she	said.	“Would	the	rover	IR	camera	do	any	good?”

“Negative,”	Johanssen	replied.	“IR	can’t	get	through	sand	any	better	than	visible
light.”

“What’s	she	thinking?”	Beck	asked	after	removing	his	helmet.	“She’s	a
geologist.	She	knows	IR	can’t	get	through	a	sandstorm.”

“She	is	grasping,”	Vogel	said,	opening	the	inner	door.	“We	must	get	to	the
couches.	Please	hurry.”

“I	don’t	feel	good	about	this,”	Beck	said.

“Neither	do	I,	Doctor,”	said	Vogel,	climbing	the	ladder.	“But	the	Commander	has
given	us	orders.	Insubordination	wil	not	help.”

“Commander,”	Martinez	radioed,	“We’re	tilting	11.6	degrees.	One	good	gust	and
we’re	tipping.”

“What	about	the	proximity	radar?”	Lewis	said,	“Could	it	detect	Watney’s	suit?”

“No	way,”	Martinez	said.	“It’s	made	to	see	Hermes	in	orbit,	not	the	metal	in	a
single	space	suit.”

“Give	it	a	try,”	Lewis	said.

“Commander,”	said	Beck,	putting	on	a	headset	as	he	slid	in	to	his	acceleration
couch.	“I	know	you	don’t	want	to	hear	this,	but	Watn-

…	Mark’s	dead.”

“Copy,”	Lewis	said.	“Martinez,	try	the	radar.”

“Roger,”	Martinez	radioed.

Bringing	the	radar	online,	he	waited	for	it	to	complete	a	self	check.	Glaring	at
Beck,	he	said	“What’s	the	matter	with	you?”

“My	friend	just	died,”	Beck	answered.	“And	I	don’t	want	my	Commander	to	die
too.”

Martinez	gave	him	a	stern	look.	Turning	his	attention	back	to	the	radar,	he
radioed	“Negative	contact	on	proximity	radar.”

“Nothing?”	Lewis	asked.

“It	can	barely	see	the	Hab,”	he	replied.	“The	sandstorm’s	fucking	things	up.
Even	if	it	wasn’t,	there’s	not	enough	metal	in-	Shit!”

“Strap	in!”	he	yeled	to	the	crew.	“We’re	tipping!”

The	MAV	began	to	creaking	as	it	tilted	faster	and	faster.

“13	degrees,”	Johanssen	caled	out	from	her	couch.

Buckling	his	restraints,	Vogel	said	“We	are	far	past	balance.	We	wil	not	rock
back.”

“We	can’t	leave	her!”	Beck	yeled.	“Let	it	tip,	we’l	fix	it!”

“32	metric	tons	including	fuel,”	Martinez	said,	his	hands	flying	over	the
controls.	“If	it	hits	the	ground,	it’l	do	structural	damage	to	the	tanks,	frame,	and
probably	the	second	stage	engine.	We’d	never	be	able	to	fix	it.”

“You	can’t	abandon	her!”	Beck	said.	“You	can’t.”

“I’ve	got	one	trick.	If	that	doesn’t	work,	I’m	folowing	her	orders.”

Bringing	the	Orbital	Maneuvering	System	online,	he	fired	a	sustained	burn	from
the	nosecone	array.	The	smal	thrusters	fought	against

the	lumbering	mass	of	the	slowly	tilting	spacecraft.

“You	are	firing	the	OMS?”	Vogel	asked.

“I	don’t	know	if	it’l	work.	We’re	not	tipping	very	fast,”	Martinez	said.	“I	think
it’s	slowing	down…”

“The	aerodynamic	caps	wil	have	automaticaly	ejected.”	Vogel	said.	“It	wil	be	a
bumpy	ascent	with	three	holes	in	the	side	of	the	ship.”

“Thanks	for	the	tip,”	Martinez	said,	maintaining	the	burn	and	watching	the	tilt
readout.	“C’mon…”

“Stil	13	degrees,”	Johanssen	reported.

“What’s	going	on	up	there?”	Lewis	radioed.	“You	went	quiet.	Respond.”

“Standby,”	Martinez	replied.

“12.9	degrees,”	Johanssen	said.

“It	is	working,”	Vogel	said.

“For	now,”	Martinez	said.	“I	don’t	know	if	maneuvering	fuel	wil	last.”

“12.8	now.”	Johanssen	supplied.

“OMS	fuel	at	60	percent,”	Beck	said.	“How	much	do	you	need	to	dock	with
Hermes?”

“10	percent	if	I	don’t	fuck	anything	up,”	Martinez	said,	adjusting	the	thrust
angle.

“12.6,”	Johanssen	said.	“We’re	tipping	back.”

“Or	the	wind	died	down	a	little,”	Beck	postulated.	“Fuel	at	45	percent.”

“There	is	danger	of	damage	to	the	vents,”	Vogel	cautioned.	“The	OMS	was	not
made	for	prolonged	thrusts,”

“I	know,”	Martinez	said.	“I	can	dock	without	nose	vents	if	I	have	to.”

“Almost	there…”	Johanssen	said.	“Ok	we’re	under	12.3.”

“OMS	cutoff,”	Martinez	announced,	terminating	the	burn.

“Stil	tipping	back,”	Johanssen	said.	“11.6…	11.5…	holding	at	11.5”

“OMS	Fuel	at	22	percent,”	Beck	said.

“Yeah,	I	see	that,”	Martinez	replied.	“It’l	be	enough.”

“Commander,”	Beck	radioed.	“You	need	to	get	to	the	ship	now.”

“Agreed,”	Martinez	radioed.	“He’s	gone,	Ma’am.	Watney’s	gone.”

The	four	crewmates	awaited	their	commander’s	response.

“Copy,”	she	finaly	replied.	“On	my	way.”

They	lay	in	silence,	strapped	to	their	couches	and	ready	for	launch.	Beck	looked
at	Watney’s	empty	couch	and	saw	Vogel	doing	the

same.	Martinez	ran	a	self-check	on	the	nosecone	OMS	thrusters.	They	were	no
longer	safe	for	use.	He	noted	the	malfunction	in	his	log.

The	airlock	cycled.	After	removing	her	suit,	Lewis	made	her	way	to	the	flight
cabin.	She	wordlessly	strapped	in	to	her	couch,	her	face	a	frozen	mask.	Only
Martinez	dared	speak.

“Stil	at	pilot	release,”	he	said	quietly.	“Ready	for	launch.”

Lewis	closed	her	eyes	and	nodded.

“I’m	sorry,	Commander,”	Martinez	said.	“You	need	to	verbaly-”

“Launch,”	she	said.

“Yes,	Ma’am,”	he	replied,	activating	the	sequence.

The	retaining	clamps	ejected	from	the	launch	gantry,	faling	to	the	ground.
Seconds	later,	preignition	pyros	fired,	igniting	the	main

engines,	and	the	MAV	lurched	upward.

The	ship	slowly	gained	speed.	As	it	did,	wind-sheer	blew	it	lateraly	off	course.
Sensing	the	problem,	the	ascent	software	angled	the

ship	in	to	the	wind	to	counteract	it.

As	fuel	was	consumed,	the	ship	got	lighter,	and	the	acceleration	more
pronounced.	Rising	at	this	exponential	rate,	the	craft	quickly

reached	maximum	acceleration.	A	limit	defined	not	by	the	ship’s	power,	but	by
the	delicate	human	bodies	inside.

As	the	ship	soared,	the	open	OMS	ports	took	their	tol.	The	crew	rocked	in	their
couches	as	the	craft	shook	violently.	Martinez	and	the

ascent	software	kept	it	trim,	though	it	was	a	constant	battle.	The	turbulence
tapered	off	and	eventualy	fel	to	nothing	as	the	atmosphere	became	thinner	and
thinner.

Suddenly,	al	force	stopped.	The	first	stage	had	completed.	The	crew	experienced
weightlessness	for	several	seconds,	then	were

pressed	back	in	to	their	couches	as	the	next	stage	began.	Outside,	the	now-empty
first	stage	fel	away,	eventualy	to	crash	on	some

unknown	area	of	the	planet	below.

The	second	stage	pushed	the	ship	ever	higher,	and	in	to	low	orbit.	Lasting	less
time	than	the	massive	first	stage,	and	running	much

smoother,	it	seemed	almost	like	an	afterthought.

Abruptly,	the	engine	stopped,	and	an	oppressive	calm	replaced	the	previous
cacophony.

“Main	engine	shutdown,”	Martinez	said.	“Ascent	time:	8	minutes,	14	seconds.
On	course	for	Hermes	intercept.”

Normaly,	an	incident-free	launch	would	be	cause	for	celebration.	This	one
earned	only	silence	broken	by	Johanssen’s	gentle	sobbing.

Four	months	later…

NASA	was	loathe	to	waste	research	time.	Trips	to	and	from	Mars	were	as	busy
as	surface	operations.	The	crew	had	almost	caught	up

with	the	backlog	of	work.	The	schedule	had	been	made	for	six,	not	five.

Beck	tried	not	to	think	about	the	painful	reason	he	was	doing	zero-g	plant
growth	experiments.	He	noted	the	size	and	shape	of	the	fern

leaves,	took	photos,	and	made	notes.

Having	completed	his	science	schedule	for	the	day,	he	checked	his	watch.
Perfect	timing.	The	data	dump	would	be	completing	soon.

He	floated	past	the	reactor	to	the	Semicone-A	ladder.

Traveling	feet-first	along	the	ladder,	he	soon	had	to	grip	it	in	earnest	as	the
centripetal	force	of	the	rotating	ship	took	hold.	By	the	time	he	reached
Semicone-A	he	was	at	0.4g.

No	mere	luxury,	the	artificial	gravity	kept	them	fit.	Without	it,	they	would	have
spent	their	first	week	on	Mars	barely	able	to	walk.

Exercise	regimens	could	keep	the	heart	and	bones	healthy,	but	none	had	been
devised	that	would	give	them	ful	function	from	Sol	1.

Because	the	ship	was	already	designed	for	it,	they	used	the	system	on	the	return
trip	as	wel.

Johanssen	sat	at	her	station.	Lewis	sat	in	the	adjacent	seat	while	Vogel	and
Martinez	hovered	nearby.	The	data	dump	carried	emails

and	videos	from	home.	It	was	the	high	point	of	the	day.

“Is	it	here	yet?”	Back	asked	as	he	entered	the	bridge.

“Almost,”	Johanssen	said.	“98%.”

“You’re	looking	cheerful,	Martinez,”	Beck	said.

“My	son	turned	three	yesterday,”	He	beamed.	“Should	be	some	pics	of	the	party.
How	about	you?”

“Nothing	special,”	Beck	said.	“Peer-reviews	of	a	paper	I	wrote	a	few	years
back.”

“Complete,”	Johanssen	said.	“Al	the	personal	emails	are	dispatched	to	your
laptops.	Also	there’s	a	telemetry	update	for	Vogel	and	a

system	update	for	me.	Huh…	there’s	a	voice	message	addressed	to	the	whole
crew.”

She	looked	over	her	shoulder	to	Lewis.

Lewis	shrugged.	“Play	it.”

Johanssen	opened	the	message,	then	sat	back.

“Hermes,	this	is	Mitch	Henderson,”	the	message	began.

“Henderson?”	Martinez	said,	puzzled.	“Talking	directly	to	us	without
CAPCOM?”

Lewis	held	her	hand	up	to	signal	for	silence.

“I	have	some	news,”	Mitch’s	voice	continued,	“There’s	no	subtle	way	to	put	this:
Mark	Watney’s	stil	alive.”

Johanssen	gasped.

“Wha-“	Beck	stammered.

Vogel	stood	agape	as	a	shocked	expression	swept	across	his	face.

Martinez	looked	to	Lewis.	She	leaned	forward	and	pinched	her	chin.

“I	know	that’s	a	surprise,”	Mitch	continued.	“And	I	know	you’l	have	a	lot	of
questions.	We’re	going	to	answer	those	questions.	But

for	now	I’l	just	give	you	the	basics.

“He’s	alive	and	healthy.	We	found	out	two	months	ago	and	decided	not	to	tel
you;	we	even	censored	personal	messages.	I	was

strongly	against	al	that.	We’re	teling	you	now	because	we	finaly	have
communication	with	him	and	a	viable	rescue	plan.	It	boils	down	to	Ares	4
picking	him	up	with	a	modified	MDV.

“We’l	get	you	a	ful	write-up	of	what	happened,	but	it’s	definitely	not	your	fault.
Mark	stresses	that	every	time	it	comes	up.	It	was	just	bad	luck.

“Take	some	time	to	absorb	this.	Your	science	schedules	are	cleared	for
tomorrow.	Send	al	the	questions	you	want	and	we’l	answer

them.	Henderson	out.”

The	message’s	end	brought	stunned	silence	to	the	bridge.

“He…He’s	alive?”	Martinez	said,	then	smiled.

Vogel	nodded	excitedly.	“He	lives.”

Johanssen	stared	at	her	screen	in	wide-eyed	disbelief.

“Holy	shit,”	Beck	laughed.	“Holy	shit!	Commander!	He’s	alive!”

“I	left	him	behind,”	Lewis	said	quietly.

The	celebrations	ceased	immediately	as	the	crew	saw	their	commander’s
inconsolable	expression.

“But,”	Beck	began,	“We	al	left	togeth-“

“You	folowed	orders,”	Lewis	interrupted.	“I	left	him	behind.	In	a	barren,
unreachable,	godforsaken	wasteland.”

Beck	looked	to	Martinez	pleadingly.	Martinez	opened	his	mouth,	but	could	find
no	words	to	say.

Lewis	trudged	off	the	bridge.

Chapter	13

The	employees	of	Deyo	Plastics	worked	double	shifts.	There	was	talk	of	triple
shifts	if	NASA	increased	the	order	again.	No

one	minded.	The	overtime	pay	was	spectacular	and	the	funding	was	limitless.

Woven	carbon	thread	ran	slowly	through	the	press,	which	sandwiched	it	between
polymer	sheets.	The	completed	material	was

folded	four	times	and	glued	together.	The	resulting	thick	sheet	was	then	coated
with	soft	resin,	and	taken	to	the	hot-room	to	set.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	114

Now	that	NASA	can	talk	to	me,	they	won’t	shut	the	hel	up.

They	want	constant	updates	on	every	Hab	system,	and	they’ve	got	a	room	ful	of
people	trying	to	micromanage	my	crops.	It’s

awesome	to	have	a	bunch	of	dipshits	on	Earth	teling	me,	a	botanist,	how	to	grow
plants.

I	mostly	ignore	them.	I	don’t	want	to	come	off	as	arrogant	here,	but	I’m	the	best
botanist	on	the	planet.

One	big	bonus:	Email!	Just	like	the	days	back	on	Hermes,	I	get	data	dumps.	Of
course	they	relay	email	from	friends	and	family,	but

NASA	also	sends	along	choice	messages	from	the	public.	I’ve	gotten	email	from
rock	stars,	athletes,	actors	and	actresses,	and	even	the

President.

The	coolest	one	is	from	my	alma-mater,	the	University	of	Chicago.	They	say
once	you	grow	crops	somewhere,	you	have	officialy

“colonized”	it.	So	technicaly,	I	colonized	Mars.

In	your	face,	Neil	Armstrong!

I	go	to	the	rover	five	times	a	day	to	check	mail.	They	can	get	a	message	from
Earth	to	Mars,	but	they	can’t	get	it	another	10	meters	to

the	Hab.	But	hey,	I	can’t	bitch.	My	odds	of	living	through	this	are	way	higher
now.

Last	I	heard,	they	solved	the	weight	problem	on	Ares	4’s	MDV.	Once	it	lands
here,	they’l	ditch	the	heat	shield,	al	the	life	support

stuff,	and	a	bunch	of	empty	fuel	tanks.	Then	they	can	take	the	seven	of	us	(Ares
4’s	crew	plus	me)	al	the	way	to	Schiapareli.	They’re

already	working	on	my	duties	for	the	surface	ops.	How	cool	is	that?

In	other	news,	I’m	learning	Morse	Code.	Why?	Because	it’s	our	back-up
communication	system.	NASA	figured	a	decades-old	probe

isn’t	ideal	as	a	sole	means	of	communication.

If	Pathfinder	craps	out,	I’l	spel	messages	with	rocks,	which	NASA	wil	see	with
satelites.	They	can’t	reply,	but	at	least	we’d	have

one-way	communication.	Why	Morse	Code?	Because	making	dots	and	dashes
with	rocks	is	a	lot	easier	than	making	letters.

It’s	a	shitty	way	to	communicate.	Hopefuly	it	won’t	come	up.

All	chemical	reactions	complete,	the	sheet	was	sterilized	and	moved	to	a
cleanroom.	There,	a	worker	cut	a	strip	off	the	edge.

Dividing	the	strip	in	to	squares,	he	put	each	through	a	series	of	rigorous	tests.

Having	passed	inspection,	the	sheet	was	then	cut	to	shape.	The	edges	were
folded	over,	sewn,	and	resealed	with	resin.	A	man

with	a	clipboard	made	final	inspections,	independently	verifying	the
measurements,	then	approved	it	for	use.

The	meddling	botanists	have	grudgingly	admitted	I	did	a	good	job.	They	agree
I’l	have	enough	food	to	last	til	Sol	900.	Bearing	that	in

mind,	NASA	has	fleshed	out	the	mission	details	of	the	supply	probe.

At	first,	they	were	working	on	a	desperate	plan	to	get	a	probe	here	before	Sol
400.	But	I	bought	another	500	sols	of	life	with	my

potato	farm	so	they	have	more	time	to	work	on	it.

They’l	launch	next	year	during	the	Hohmann	Transfer	Window,	and	it’l	take
almost	9	months	to	get	here.	It	should	arrive	around	Sol

856.	It’l	have	plenty	of	food,	a	spare	Oxygenator,	Water	Reclaimer,	and	comm
system.	Three	comm	systems,	actualy.	I	guess	they	aren’t

taking	any	chances,	what	with	my	habit	of	being	nearby	when	radios	break.

Got	my	first	email	from	Hermes	today.	NASA’s	been	limiting	direct	contact.	I
guess	they’re	afraid	I’l	say	something	like	“You

abandoned	me	on	Mars	you	fuckwits!”	I	know	the	crew	is	surprised	to	hear	from
the	Ghost	of	Mars	Missions	Past,	but	c’mon.	I	wish

NASA	was	less	of	a	nanny	sometimes.	Anyway,	they	finaly	let	one	email
through	from	Martinez:

Dear	Watney:	Sorry	we	left	you	behind,	but	we	don't	like	you.	You're	sort	of	a

smart-ass.	And	it's	a	lot	roomier	on	Hermes	without	you.	We	have	to	take	turns

doing	your	tasks,	but	it's	only	botany	(not	real	science)	so	it's	easy.	How's	Mars?

-Martinez

My	reply:

Dear	Martinez:	Mars	is	fine.	When	I	get	lonely	I	think	of	that	steamy	night	I

spent	with	your	mom.	How	are	things	on	Hermes?	Cramped	and	claustrophobic?

Yesterday	I	went	outside	and	looked	at	the	vast	horizons.	I	tell	ya,	Martinez,	they

go	on	forever!

-Watney

The	employees	carefully	folded	the	sheet,	and	placed	it	in	an	argon-filled	airtight
shipping	container.	Printing	out	a	sticker,

the	man	with	the	clipboard	placed	it	on	the	package.	“Project	Ares-3;	Hab
Canvas;	Sheet	AL102.”

The	package	was	placed	on	a	charter	plane	and	flown	to	Edwards	Air	Force
Base	in	California.	It	flew	abnormally	high,	at

great	cost	of	fuel,	to	ensure	a	smoother	flight.

Upon	arrival,	the	package	was	carefully	transported	by	special	convoy	to
Pasadena.	Once	there,	it	was	moved	to	the	JPL

White	Room	for	probe	assembly.	Over	the	next	5	weeks,	engineers	in	white
bodysuits	assembled	Presupply	309.	It	contained

AL102	as	well	as	12	other	Hab	Canvas	packages.

It’s	almost	time	for	the	second	harvest.

Ayup.

I	wish	I	had	a	straw	hat	and	some	suspenders.

My	re-seed	of	the	potatoes	went	wel.	I'm	beginning	to	see	that	crops	on	Mars	are
extremely	prolific,	thanks	to	the	bilions	of	dolars

worth	of	life	support	equipment	around	me.	I	now	have	400	healthy	potato
plants,	each	one	making	lots	of	calorie-filed	taters	for	my	dining	enjoyment.	In
just	ten	days	they’l	be	ripe!

And	this	time,	I’m	not	replanting	them	as	seed.	This	is	my	food	supply.	Al

natural,	organic,	Martian-grown	potatoes.	Don’t	hear	that

every	day,	do	you?

You	may	be	wondering	how	I’l	store	them.	I	can’t	just	pile	them	up;	most	of
them	would	go	bad	before	I	got	around	to	eating	them.

So	instead,	I’l	do	something	that	wouldn’t	work	at	al	on	Earth:	Throw	them
outside.

Most	of	the	water	wil	be	sucked	out	by	the	near-vacuum;	what’s	left	wil	freeze

screaming.

In	other	news,	I	got	email	from	Venkat	Kapoor:

Mark,	some	answers	to	your	earlier	questions:

No,	we	will	not	tell	our	Botany	Team	to	“Go	fuck	themselves.”	I	understand
you’ve

been	on	your	own	for	a	long	time,	but	we’re	in	the	loop	now,	and	it’s	best	if	you

listen	to	what	we	have	to	say.

denied.	Enjoy	your	boogie	fever.

Also,	an	uncomfortable	side	note...	NASA	is	putting	together	a	committee.	They

want	to	see	if	there	were	any	avoidable	mistakes	that	led	you	to	being	stranded.

Just	a	heads-up.	They	may	have	questions	for	you	later	on.

Keep	us	posted	on	your	activities.

My	reply:

Venkat,	tell	the	investigation	committee	they’ll	have	to	do	their	witch-hunt

without	me.	And	when	they	inevitably	blame	Commander	Lewis,	be	advised	I’ll

Also	please	tell	them	that	each	and	every	one	of	their	mothers	are	prostitutes.

PS:	Their	sisters,	too.

The	presupply	probes	for	Ares-3	launched	on	14	consecutive	days	during	the
Hohmann	Transfer	window.	Presupply	309	was

launched	third.	The	251	day	trip	to	Mars	was	uneventful,	needing	only	two
minor	course	adjustments.

After	several	aerobraking	maneuvers	to	slow	down,	it	made	its	final	descent
toward	Acidalia	Planitia.	First,	it	endured

reentry	via	a	heat	shield.	Later,	it	released	a	parachute	and	detached	the	now
expended	shield.

Once	its	onboard	radar	detected	it	was	30	meters	from	the	ground,	it	cut	loose
the	parachute	and	inflated	balloons	all	around

its	hull.	It	fell	unceremoniously	to	the	surface,	bouncing	and	rolling,	until	it
finally	came	to	rest.

Deflating	its	balloons,	the	onboard	computer	reported	the	successful	landing

The	Water	Reclaimer	is	acting	up.

Six	people	wil	go	through	18	liters	of	water	per	day.	So	it’s	made	to	process	20.
But	lately,	it	hasn’t	been	keeping	up.	It’s	doing	10,

tops.

Do	I	generate	10	liters	of	water	per	day?	No,	I’m	not	the	urinating	champion	of
al	time.	It’s	the	crops.	The	humidity	inside	the	Hab	is	a	lot	higher	than	it	was
designed	for,	so	the	Water	Reclaimer	is	constantly	filtering	it	out	of	the	air.

I’m	not	worried	about	it.	Water	is	water.	The	plants	use	it,	I	use	it.	If	need	be,	I
can	piss	on	the	plants	directly.	It’l	evaporate	and	condense	on	the	wals.	I	could
make	something	to	colect	it,	I’m	sure.	Thing	is,	the	water	can’t	go	anywhere.	It’s
a	closed	system.	Plus,	I	made	like	600	liters	from	MDV	fuel	(remember	the
“explosive	Hab”	incident?).	I	could	take	baths	and	stil	have	plenty	left	over.

NASA,	however,	is	absolutely	shitting	itself.	They	see	the	Water	Reclaimer	as	a
critical	survival	element.	There’s	no	backup,	and	they

think	I’l	die	instantly	without	it.	To	them,	equipment	failure	is	terrifying.	To	me,
it’s	“Tuesday.”

So	instead	of	preparing	for	my	harvest,	I	have	to	make	extra	trips	to	and	from	the
rover	to	answer	their	questions.	Each	new	message

instructs	me	to	try	some	new	solution	and	report	the	results	back.

So	far	we’ve	worked	out	it’s	not	the	electronics,	refrigeration	system,
instrumentation,	or	temperature.	I’m	sure	it’l	turn	out	to	be	a	little	hole
somewhere,	then	NASA	wil	have	4	hours	of	meetings	before	teling	me	to	cover
it	with	duct	tape.

Lewis	and	Beck	opened	Presupply	309.	Working	as	best	they	could	in	their	bulky
EVA	suits,	they	removed	the	various	portions

of	Hab	canvas	and	lay	them	on	the	ground.	Three	entire	presupply	probes	were
dedicated	to	the	Hab.

Following	a	procedure	they	had	practiced	hundreds	of	times,	they	efficiently
assembled	the	pieces.	Special	seal-strips	between

the	patches	ensured	air-tight	mating.

After	erecting	the	main	structure	of	the	Hab,	they	assembled	the	three	airlocks.
Sheet	AL102	had	a	hole	perfectly	sized	for

Airlock	1.	Beck	stretched	the	sheet	tight	to	the	seal-strips	on	the	airlock’s
exterior.

Once	all	airlocks	were	in	place,	Lewis	flooded	the	Hab	with	air	and	AL102	felt
pressure	for	the	first	time.	They	waited	an

hour.	No	pressure	was	lost;	the	setup	had	been	perfect.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	118

My	conversation	with	NASA	about	the	Water	Reclaimer	was	boring	and	riddled
with	technical	details.	So	I’l	paraphrase	it	for	you:

Me:	“This	is	obviously	a	clog.	How	about	I	take	the	it	apart	and	check	the
internal	tubing?”

NASA:	(After	5	hours	of	deliberation)	“No.	You’l	fuck	it	up	and	die.”

So	I	took	it	apart.

Yeah,	I	know.	NASA	has	a	lot	of	ultra-smart	people	and	I	should	realy	do	what
they	say.	And	I’m	being	too	adversarial,	considering

they	spend	al	day	working	on	how	to	save	my	life.

I	just	get	sick	of	being	told	how	to	wipe	my	ass.	Independence	was	one	of	the
things	they	looked	for	when	choosing	Ares	astronauts.

It’s	a	13-month	mission,	most	of	it	spent	many	light-minutes	away	from	Earth.
They	wanted	people	who	would	act	on	their	own	initiative,

but	at	the	same	time,	obey	their	Commander.

If	Commander	Lewis	were	here,	I’d	do	whatever	she	said,	no	problem.	But	a
committee	of	faceless	bureaucrats	back	on	Earth?	Sorry,

I’m	just	having	a	tough	time	with	it.

I	was	realy	careful.	I	labeled	every	piece	as	I	dismantled	it,	and	laid	everything
out	on	a	table.	I	have	the	schematics	in	the	computer,	so	nothing	was	a	surprise.

And	just	as	I’d	suspected,	there	was	a	clogged	tube.	The	Water	Reclaimer	was
designed	to	purify	urine	and	strain	humidity	out	of	the

air	(you	exhale	almost	as	much	water	as	you	piss).	I’ve	mixed	my	water	with
soil,	making	it	mineral	water.	The	minerals	built	up	in	the

Water	Reclaimer.

I	cleaned	out	the	tubing	and	put	it	al	back	together.	It	completely	solved	the
problem.	I’l	have	to	do	it	again	some	day,	but	not	for	100

sols	or	so.	No	big	deal.

I	told	NASA	what	I	did.	Our	(paraphrased)	conversation	was:

Me:	“I	took	it	apart,	found	the	problem,	and	fixed	it.”

NASA:	“Dick.”

AL102	shuddered	in	the	brutal	storm.	Withstanding	forces	and	pressure	far
greater	than	its	design,	it	rippled	violently	against

the	airlock	seal-strip.	Other	sections	of	canvas	undulated	along	their	seal-strips
together,	acting	as	a	single	sheet,	but	AL102	had	no	such	luxury.	The	airlock
barely	moved,	leaving	AL102	to	take	the	full	force	of	the	tempest.

The	layers	of	plastic,	constantly	bending,	heated	the	resin	from	pure	friction.	The
new,	more	yielding	environment	allowed	the

carbon	fibers	to	separate.

AL102	stretched.

Not	much.	Only	4	millimeters.	But	the	carbon	fibers,	usually	500	microns	apart,
now	had	a	gap	eight	times	that	width	in	their

midst.

After	the	storm	abated,	the	lone	remaining	astronaut	performed	a	full	inspection
of	the	Hab.	But	he	didn’t	notice	anything

amiss.	The	weak	part	of	canvas	was	concealed	by	a	seal-strip.

Designed	for	a	mission	of	31	sols,	AL102	continued	well	past	its	planned
expiration.	Sol	after	sol	went	by,	with	the	lone

astronaut	traveling	in	and	out	of	the	Hab	almost	daily.	Airlock	1	was	closest	to
the	rover	charging	station,	so	the	astronaut

I	woke	up	last	night	to	the	Hab	shaking.

The	medium-grade	sandstorm	ended	as	suddenly	as	it	began.	It	was	only	a
category	3	storm	with	50kph	winds.	Nothing	to	worry

about.	Stil,	it’s	bit	disconcerting	to	hear	howling	winds	when	you’re	used	to	utter
silence.

I’m	worried	about	Pathfinder.	If	the	sandstorm	damaged	it,	I’l	have	lost	my
connection	to	NASA.	Logicaly,	I	shouldn’t	worry.	The

thing’s	been	on	the	surface	for	decades.	A	little	gale	won’t	do	any	harm.

When	I	head	outside,	I’l	confirm	Pathfinder’s	stil	functional	before	moving	on	to

the	sweaty,	annoying	work	of	the	day.

Yes,	with	each	sandstorm	comes	the	inevitable	Cleaning	of	the	Solar	Cels.	A
time	honored	tradition	by	hearty	Martians	such	as	myself.

It	reminds	me	of	growing	up	in	Chicago	and	having	to	shovel	snow.	I’l	give	my
dad	credit;	he	never	claimed	it	was	to	build	character	or

teach	me	the	value	of	hard	work.

“Snow-blowers	are	expensive,”	he	used	to	say.	“You’re	free.”

Once,	I	tried	to	appeal	to	my	mom.	“Don’t	be	such	a	wuss,”	She	suggested.

In	other	news,	It’s	seven	sols	til	the	harvest,	and	I	stil	haven’t	prepared.	For
starters,	I	need	to	make	a	hoe.	Also,	I	need	to	make	an	outdoor	shed	for	the
potatoes.	I	can’t	just	pile	them	up	outside.	The	next	major	storm	would	cause
The	Great	Martian	Potato	Migration.

Anyway,	al	that	wil	have	to	wait.	I’ve	got	a	ful	day	today.	After	cleaning	the
solar	cels,	I	have	to	check	the	whole	solar	array	make

sure	the	storm	didn’t	hurt	it.	Then	I’l	need	to	do	the	same	for	the	rover.

I	better	get	started.

Airlock	1	slowly	depressurized	to	1/90th	of	an	atmosphere.	Watney,	donning	an
EVA	suit,	waited	for	it	to	complete.	He	had	done	it

literaly	hundreds	of	times.	Any	apprehension	he	may	have	had	on	Sol	1	was	long
gone.	Now	it	was	merely	a	boring	chore	before	exiting	to

the	surface.

As	the	depressurization	continued,	the	Hab’s	atmosphere	compressed	the	airlock
and	AL102	stretched	for	the	last	time.

On	Sol	119,	the	Hab	breached.

The	initial	tear	was	less	than	1	milimeter.	The	perpendicular	carbon	fibers	should
have	prevented	the	rip	from	growing.	But	countless

abuses	had	stretched	the	vertical	fibers	apart	and	weakened	the	horizontal	ones
beyond	use.

The	ful	force	of	the	Hab’s	atmosphere	rushed	through	the	breach.	Within	a	tenth
of	a	second,	the	rip	was	a	meter	long,	running	paralel

to	the	seal-strip.	It	propagated	al	the	way	around	until	it	met	its	starting	point.
The	airlock	was	no	longer	attached	to	the	Hab.

The	unopposed	pressure	violently	launched	the	airlock	like	a	cannonbal	as	the
Hab	exploded.	Inside,	the	surprised	Watney	slammed

against	the	airlock’s	back	door	with	the	force	of	the	expulsion.

The	airlock	flew	40	meters	before	hitting	the	ground.	Watney,	barely	recovered
from	the	earlier	shock,	now	endured	another	as	he	hit

the	front	door,	face	first.

His	faceplate	took	the	brunt	of	the	blow,	the	safety	glass	shattering	into	hundreds
of	smal	cubes.	His	head	slammed	against	the	inside	of	the	helmet,	knocking	him
senseless.

The	airlock	tumbled	across	the	surface	for	a	further	15	meters.	The	heavy
padding	of	Watney’s	suit	saved	him	from	many	broken

bones.	He	tried	to	make	sense	of	the	situation,	but	was	barely	conscious.

Finaly	done	tumbling,	the	airlock	rested	on	its	side	amid	a	cloud	of	dust.

Watney,	on	his	back,	stared	blankly	upward	through	the	hole	in	his	shattered
faceplate.	A	gash	in	his	forehead	trickled	blood	down	his

face.

Regaining	some	of	his	wits,	he	got	his	bearings.	Turning	his	head	to	the	side,	he
looked	through	the	back	door’s	window.	The	colapsed

Hab	rippled	in	the	distance,	a	junkyard	of	debris	strewn	across	the	landscape	in
front	of	it.

Then,	a	hissing	sound	reached	his	ears.	Listening	carefuly,	he	realized	it	was	not
coming	from	his	suit.	Somewhere	in	the	phone-booth

sized	airlock,	a	smal	breach	was	letting	air	escape.

He	listened	intently	to	the	hiss.	Then	he	touched	his	broken	faceplate.	Then	he
looked	out	the	window	again.

“You	fucking	kidding	me?”	He	said.

RECORDING:

I’ve	been	laying	here	for	a	little	while,	trying	to	figure	out	what	happened.	I
should	be	more	upset,	but	I	took	a	pretty	good	whack	to

the	head.	It	had	a	calming	effect.

So…

Wel,	ok.

I’m	in	the	airlock.	I	can	see	the	Hab	out	the	window;	it’s	a	good	50	meters	away.
Normaly,	the	airlock	is	attached	to	the	Hab.	So	that’s	a	problem.

The	airlock’s	on	its	side,	and	I	can	hear	a	steady	hiss.	So	either	it’s	leaking	or
there	are	snakes	in	here.	Either	way,	I’m	in	trouble.

Also,	during	the…	whatever	the	fuck	happened…	I	got	bounced	around	like	a
pinbal	and	smashed	my	faceplate.	Air	is	notoriously

uncooperative	when	it	comes	to	giant,	gaping	holes	in	your	EVA	suit.

Looks	like	the	Hab	is	completely	deflated	and	colapsed.	So	even	if	I	had	a
functional	EVA	suit	to	leave	the	airlock	with,	I	wouldn’t

have	anywhere	to	go.	So	that	sucks.

I	gotta’	think	for	a	minute.	And	I	have	to	get	out	of	this	EVA	suit.	It’s	bulky,	and
the	airlock	is	cramped.	Besides,	it’s	not	like	it’s	doing	me	any	good.

AUDIO	LOG:	SOL	119

RECORDING:

Things	aren’t	as	bad	as	they	seem.

I’m	stil	fucked,	mind	you.	Just	not	as	deeply.

Not	sure	what	happened	to	the	Hab,	but	the	rover’s	probably	fine.	It’s	not	ideal,
but	at	least	it’s	not	leaky	phone	booth.

I’m	wearing	Beck’s	EVA	suit.	I	haven’t	worn	my	own	since	Sol	6	when	I	got
shish-kabobed.	Beck’s	suit	was	about	the	right	size	and

didn’t	have	a	hole	in	it.	Why	does	that	matter	right	now?	Because,	unlike	my
original	suit,	this	one	stil	has	an	unused	patch	kit.

Don’t	get	excited.	It	won’t	do	the	suit	any	good.	The	patch	kit	is	a	cone-shaped
valve	with	super	sticky	resin	on	the	wide	end.	It’s	just	too	smal	to	deal	with	a
hole	larger	than	8cm.	And	realy,	if	you	have	a	9cm	hole,	you’re	going	to	be	dead
way	before	you	could	whip	out

the	kit.

Stil,	it’s	an	asset,	and	maybe	I	can	use	it	to	stop	the	airlock	leak.	And	that’s	my
top	priority	right	now.

It’s	a	smal	leak.	With	the	faceplate	gone,	the	EVA	suit	is	effectively	managing
the	whole	airlock.	It’s	been	adding	air	to	make	up	for	the	missing	pressure.	But
it’l	run	out	eventualy.

I	need	to	find	the	leak.	I	think	it’s	near	my	feet,	judging	by	the	sound.	Now	that
I’m	out	of	the	suit,	I	can	turn	around	and	get	a	look…

I	don’t	see	anything…	I	can	hear	it,	but…	it’s	down	here	somewhere,	but	I	don’t
know	where.

I	can	only	think	of	one	way	to	find	it:	Start	a	fire!

Yeah,	I	know.	A	lot	of	my	ideas	involve	setting	something	on	fire.	And	yes,
deliberately	starting	a	fire	in	a	tiny,	enclosed	space	is	usualy	a	terrible	idea.	But	I
need	the	smoke.	Just	a	little	wisp	of	it.

As	usual,	I’m	working	with	stuff	that	was	deliberately	designed	not	to	burn.	But

no	amount	of	careful	design	by	NASA	can	get	around

a	determined	arsonist	with	a	tank	of	pure	oxygen.

The	EVA	suit	is	made	entirely	of	non-flammable	materials.	So	is	the	airlock.	My
clothes	are	fireproof	as	wel,	even	the	thread.

I	was	originaly	planning	to	check	the	solar	array,	doing	repairs	as	needed	after
last	night’s	storm.	So	I	have	my	toolbox	with	me.	But

looking	through	it,	it’s	al	metal	or	non-flammable	plastic.

I	just	realized	I	do	have	something	flammable:	My	own	hair.	It’l	have	to	do.
There’s	a	sharp	knife	in	the	tool-kit.	I’l	shave	some	arm

hairs	off	into	a	little	pile.

Next	step:	oxygen.	Back	when	I	turned	the	hydrazine	into	water,	I	had	tubing,
garbage	bags,	and	al	sorts	of	other	luxuries.	I	won’t

have	anything	so	refined	is	a	pure	oxygen	flow.	Al	I	can	do	is	muck	with	the
EVA	suit	controls	to	increase	oxygen	percentage	in	the	whole	airlock.	I	figure
bumping	it	to	40%	wil	do.

Al	I	need	now	is	a	spark.

The	EVA	suit	has	electronics,	but	it	runs	on	very	low	voltage.	I	don’t	think	I
could	get	an	arc	with	it.	Besides,	I	don’t	want	to	tear	up	my	suit’s	electronics.	I
need	it	working	to	get	from	the	airlock	to	the	rover.

The	airlock	itself	has	electronics,	but	it	ran	on	Hab	power.	I	guess	NASA	never
considered	what	would	happen	if	it	was	launched	50

meters.	Lazy	bums.

Plastic	might	not	burn,	but	anyone	whose	played	with	a	baloon	knows	it’s	great
at	building	up	static	charge.	Once	I	do	that,	I	should	be	able	to	make	a	spark	just
by	touching	a	metal	tool.

Fun	fact:	This	is	exactly	how	the	Apolo	1	crew	died.	Wish	me	luck!

AUDIO	LOG:	SOL	119

RECORDING:

I’m	in	a	box	ful	of	burning	hair	smel.	It’s	not	a	good	smel.

On	my	first	try,	the	fire	lit,	but	the	smoke	just	drifted	randomly	around.	My	own
breathing	was	screwing	it	up.	So	I	held	my	breath	and

tried	again.

My	second	try,	the	EVA	suit	threw	everything	off.	There’s	a	gentle	flow	of	air
coming	out	of	the	faceplate	as	the	suit	constantly	replaces	the	missing	air.	So	I
shut	the	suit	down,	held	my	breath,	and	tried	again.	I	had	to	be	quick;	the
pressure	was	dropping.

My	third	try,	the	quick	arm	movements	I	used	to	set	the	fire	messed	everything
up.	Just	moving	around	makes	enough	turbulence	to

send	the	smoke	everywhere.

The	fourth	time	I	kept	the	suit	turned	off,	held	my	breath,	and	when	the	time
came	to	light	the	fire,	I	did	it	very	slowly.	Then	I	watched	as	the	little	wisp	of
smoke	drifted	toward	the	floor	of	the	airlock,	disappearing	through	a	hairline
fracture.

I	have	you	now,	little	leak!

I	gasped	for	air	and	turned	the	EVA	suit	back	on.	The	pressure	had	dropped	to
0.9	atmospheres	during	my	little	experiment.	But	there

was	plenty	of	oxygen	in	the	air	for	me	any	my	hair-fire	to	breathe.	The	suit
quickly	got	things	back	to	normal.

Looking	at	the	fracture,	it’s	pretty	tiny.	It	would	be	a	cinch	to	seal	it	with	the
suit’s	patch	kit,	but	now	that	I	think	about	it,	that’s	a	bad	idea.

I’l	need	to	do	some	kind	of	repair	to	the	faceplate.	I	don’t	know	how	just	yet,	but
the	patch	kit	and	its	pressure-resistant	resin	is

probably	realy	important.	And	I	can’t	do	it	bit	by	bit,	either.	Once	I	break	the
seal	on	the	patch	kit,	the	binary	components	of	the	resin	mix	and	I	have	60
seconds	before	it	hardens.	I	can’t	just	take	a	little	to	fix	the	crack.

Given	time,	I	might	be	able	to	come	up	with	a	plan	for	the	faceplate.	Then,	I
could	take	a	few	seconds	during	that	plan	to	scrape	resin

over	the	airlock	fracture.	But	I	don’t	have	time.

I’m	down	to	40%	of	my	N2	tank.	I	need	to	seal	that	fracture	now,	and	I	need	to
do	it	without	using	the	patch	kit.

First	idea:	Little	Dutch	Boy.	I’m	licking	my	palm	and	placing	it	over	the	crack.

Ok…	I	can’t	quite	make	a	perfect	seal,	so	there’s	airflow…	getting	colder	now…
getting	pretty	uncomfortable…	ok	fuck	this.

On	to	idea	number	two.	Tape!

I	have	duct	tape	in	my	tool	box.	Let’s	slap	some	on	and	see	if	it	slows	the	flow.	I
wonder	how	long	it	wil	last	before	the	pressure	rips	it.	Putting	it	on	now.

There	we	go…	stil	holding…

Lemme	check	the	suit…	Readouts	say	the	pressure	is	stable.	Looks	like	the	duct
tape	made	a	good	seal.

Let’s	see	if	it	holds…

AUDIO	LOG:	SOL	119

RECORDING:

It’s	been	15	minutes,	and	the	tape	is	stil	holding.	Looks	like	that	problem	is
solved.

Sort	of	anticlimactic,	realy.	I	was	already	working	out	how	to	cover	the	breach
with	ice.	I	have	2	liters	of	water	in	the	EVA	suit’s

“hamster-feeder”.	I	could	have	shut	off	the	suit’s	heating	systems	and	let	the
airlock	cool	to	freezing.	Then	I’d…	wel	whatever.

Coulda’	done	it	with	ice.	I’m	just	sayin’.

Al	right.	On	to	my	next	problem:	How	do	I	fix	the	EVA	suit?	Duct	tape	might
seal	a	hairline	crack,	but	it	can’t	hold	an	atmosphere	of

pressure	against	the	size	of	my	broken	faceplate.

The	patch	kit	is	too	smal,	but	stil	useful.	I	can	spread	the	resin	around	the	edge
of	where	the	faceplate	was,	then	stick	something	on	to	cover	the	hole.	Problem
is,	what	do	I	use	to	cover	the	hole?	Something	that	can	stand	up	to	a	lot	of
pressure.

Looking	around,	the	only	thing	I	see	that	can	hold	an	atmosphere	is	the	EVA	suit
itself.	There’s	plenty	of	material	to	work	with,	and	I

can	even	cut	it.	Remember	when	I	was	cutting	Hab	canvas	in	to	strips?	Those
same	sheers	are	right	here	in	my	tool	kit.

Cutting	a	chunk	out	of	my	EVA	suit	leaves	it	with	another	hole.	But	a	hole	I	can
control	the	shape	and	location	of.

Yeah…	I	think	I	see	a	solution	here.	I’m	going	to	cut	off	my	arm!

Wel,	no.	Not	my	arm.	The	EVA	suit’s	arm.	I’l	cut	right	below	the	left	elbow.
Then	I	can	cut	along	its	length,	turning	it	into	a	rectangle.

It’l	be	big	enough	to	seal	the	faceplate,	and	it’l	be	held	in	place	by	the	resin.

Material	designed	to	withstand	atmospheric	pressure?	Check.

Resin	designed	to	seal	a	breach	against	that	pressure?	Check.

And	what	about	the	gaping	hole	on	the	stumpy	arm?	Unlike	my	faceplate,	the
suit’s	material	is	flexible.	I’l	press	it	together	and	seal	it	with	resin.	I’l	have	to
press	my	left	arm	against	my	side	while	I’m	in	the	suit,	but	there’l	be	room.

I’l	be	spreading	the	resin	pretty	thin,	but	it’s	literaly	the	strongest	adhesive
known	to	man.	And	it	doesn’t	have	to	be	a	perfect	seal.	It	just	has	to	last	long
enough	for	me	to	get	to	safety.

And	where	wil	that	“safety”	be?	Not	a	damn	clue.

Anyway,	one	problem	at	a	time.	Right	now	I’m	fixing	the	EVA	suit.

AUDIO	LOG:	SOL	119

RECORDING:

Cutting	the	arm	off	the	suit	was	easy;	so	was	cutting	along	its	length	to	make	a
rectangle.	Those	sheers	are	strong	as	hel.

Cleaning	the	glass	off	the	faceplate	took	longer	than	I’d	expected.	It’s	unlikely	it
would	puncture	EVA	suit	material,	but	I’m	not	taking	any	chances.	Besides,	I
don’t	want	glass	in	my	face	when	I’m	wearing	it.

Then	came	the	tricky	part.	Once	I	broke	the	seal	on	the	patch	kit,	I	had	60
seconds	before	the	resin	set.	I	scooped	it	off	the	patch	kit	with	my	fingers	and
quickly	spread	it	around	the	rim	of	the	faceplate.	Then,	I	took	what	was	left	and
sealed	the	arm	hole.

I	pressed	the	rectangle	of	suit	material	on	to	the	helmet.	I	held	it	firmly	with	both
hands	while	using	my	knee	to	keep	pressure	on	the

arm’s	seam.

I	held	on	until	I’d	counted	120	seconds.	Just	to	be	sure.

It	seemed	to	work	wel.	The	seal	looked	strong	and	the	resin	was	rock-hard.	I	did,
however,	glue	my	hand	to	the	helmet.

Stop	laughing.

In	retrospect,	using	my	fingers	to	spread	the	resin	wasn’t	the	best	plan.
Fortunately,	my	left	hand	was	stil	free.	After	some	grunting	and	a	lot	of
profanities,	I	was	able	to	reach	the	tool	box.	Once	I	got	a	screwdriver	I	chiseled
myself	free	(feeling	realy	stupid	the	whole	time.)	Using	the	arm	computer,	I	had
the	suit	overpressurize	to	1.2	atmospheres.	The	faceplate	patch	bowed	outward,
but	otherwise	held

firm.	The	arm	filed	in,	threatening	to	tear	the	new	seam,	but	stayed	in	one	piece.

Then	I	watched	the	readouts	to	see	how	airtight	things	were.

Answer:	Not	very.

The	suit	is	designed	for	8	hours	of	use.	That	works	out	to	250ml	of	liquid
oxygen.	Just	to	be	safe,	the	suit	has	a	ful	liter	of	O2	capacity.

But	that’s	only	half	the	story.

The	rest	of	the	air	is	nitrogen.	It’s	just	there	to	add	pressure.	When	the	suit	leaks,
that’s	what	it	backfils	with.	The	suit	has	2	liters	of	liquid	N2	storage.

It	absolutely	pissed	the	air	out.	In	60	seconds	it	leaked	so	much	it	pressurized	the
whole	airlock	to	1.2	atmospheres.

Let’s	cal	the	volume	of	the	airlock	2	cubic	meters.	The	inflated	EVA	suit
probably	takes	up	half	of	it.	So	it	took	5	minutes	to	add	0.2

atmospheres	to	1	cubic	meter.	That’s	285g	of	air	(trust	me	on	the	math).	The	air
in	the	tanks	is	around	1	gram	per	cubic	centimeter,

meaning	I	just	lost	285ml.

The	three	tanks	combined	had	3000ml	to	start	with.	A	lot	of	that	was	used	to
maintain	pressure	while	the	airlock	was	leaking.	Also,	my

breathing	turned	some	oxygen	in	to	carbon	dioxide,	which	was	captured	by	the
suit’s	CO2	filters.

Checking	the	readouts,	I	have	410ml	of	oxygen,	738ml	of	nitrogen.	Together,
they	make	almost	1150ml	to	work	with.	That,	divided	by

285ml	lost	per	minute…

Once	I’m	out	of	the	airlock,	this	EVA	suit	wil	only	last	4	minutes.

Fuck.

I’l	need	another	suit.	Martinez’s	used	to	be	in	the	rover.	I	hauled	it	al	the	way	to
the	Pathfinder	site	and	back,	just	in	case	I	needed	a	spare.	But	when	I	returned,	I
put	it	back	in	the	Hab.

Damn	it!

Al	right,	so	I’l	need	to	get	another	suit	before	going	to	the	rover.	Which	one?
Johanssen’s	is	too	smal	for	me	(tiny	little	gal,	our

Johanssen).	Lewis’s	is	ful	of	water.	Actualy,	by	now	it’s	ful	of	slowly
sublimating	ice.	The	mangled,	glued	together	suit	I	have	with	me	is	Beck’s;	my
original	suit	has	a	hole	in	it.	That	just	leaves	Martinez	and	Vogel.

I	left	Martinez’s	near	my	bunk,	in	case	I	needed	a	suit	in	a	hurry.	Of	course,	after
that	sudden	decompression,	it	could	be	anywhere.

Stil,	it’s	a	place	to	start.

Next	problem:	I’m	like	50	meters	from	the	Hab.	Running	in	0.4g	while	wearing
a	bulky	EVA	suit	isn’t	easy.	At	best,	I	can	trundle	2

meters	per	second.	That’s	a	precious	25	seconds;	almost	an	eighth	of	my	4
minutes.	I’ve	got	to	bring	that	down.

But	how?

AUDIO	LOG:	SOL	119

RECORDING:

I’l	rol	the	damn	airlock.

It’s	basicaly	a	phone	booth	on	its	side.	I	did	some	experiments.

I	figured	if	I	want	it	to	rol,	I’l	need	to	hit	the	wal	as	hard	as	possible.	And	I	have
to	be	in	the	air	at	the	time.	I	can’t	press	against	some	other	part	of	the	airlock.
The	forces	would	cancel	and	it	wouldn’t	move	at	al.

First	I	tried	launching	myself	off	one	wal	and	slamming	in	to	the	other.	The
airlock	slid	a	little,	but	that’s	it.

Next,	I	tried	doing	a	super-pushup	to	get	airborne	(0.4g	yay!)	then	kicking	the
wal	with	both	feet.	Again,	it	just	slid.

The	third	time,	I	got	it	right.	The	trick	is	to	plant	both	my	feet	on	the	ground,
near	the	wal.	Then	I	launch	myself	to	the	top	of	the

opposite	wal	and	hit	with	my	back.	When	I	tried	that	just	now,	it	was	enough
force	and	leverage	to	tip	the	airlock	and	rol	it	one	face

toward	the	Hab.

The	airlock	is	a	meter	wide,	so…	sigh…	I	have	to	do	it	like	50	more	times.

I’m	gonna	have	a	hel	of	a	backache	after	this.

AUDIO	LOG:	SOL	120

RECORDING:

I	have	a	hel	of	a	backache.

The	subtle	and	refined	“hurl	my	body	at	the	wal”	technique	had	some	flaws.	It
only	worked	one	out	of	every	10	tries,	and	it	hurt	a	lot.	I	had	to	take	breaks,
stretch	out,	and	generaly	convince	myself	to	body-slam	the	wal	again	and	again.

It	took	al	damn	night,	but	I	made	it.

I’m	10	meters	from	the	Hab	now.	I	can’t	get	any	closer,	cause	the	debris	from	the
decompression	is	al	over	the	place.	This	isn’t	an

“al-terrain”	airlock.	I	can’t	rol	over	that	shit.

It	was	morning	when	the	Hab	popped.	Now	it’s	morning	again.	I’ve	been	in	this
damn	box	for	an	entire	day.	But	I’m	leaving	soon.

I’m	in	the	EVA	suit	now,	and	ready	to	rol.

Al	right…	ok….	Once	more	through	the	plan:	Use	the	manual	valves	to	equalize
the	airlock.	Get	out	and	hurry	to	the	Hab.	Wander

around	under	the	colapsed	canvas.	Find	Martinez’s	suit	(or	Vogel’s	if	I	run	in	to
it	first).	Get	to	the	rover.	Then	I’m	safe.

If	I	run	out	of	time	before	finding	a	suit,	I’l	just	run	to	the	rover.	I’d	be	in
trouble,	but	I’d	have	time	to	think	and	materials	to	work	with.

Deep	breath…	here	we	go!

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	120

I’m	alive!	And	I’m	in	the	rover!

Things	didn’t	go	exactly	as	planned,	but	I’m	not	dead,	so	it’s	a	win.

Equalizing	the	airlock	went	fine.	I	was	out	on	the	surface	within	30	seconds.
Skipping	toward	the	Hab	(the	fastest	way	to	move	in	this

gravity)	I	passed	through	the	field	of	debris.	The	rupture	had	realy	sent	things
flying,	myself	included.

It	was	hard	to	see;	my	faceplate	was	covered	by	the	makeshift	patch.	Fortunately,
my	arm	had	a	camera.	NASA	discovered	that

turning	your	whole	EVA-suited	body	to	look	at	something	was	a	strenuous	waste
of	time.	So	they	mounted	a	smal	camera	on	the	right

arm.	The	feed	is	projected	on	the	inner	faceplate.	This	alows	us	to	look	at	things
just	by	pointing	at	them.

I	had	to	look	at	a	rippled,	messed-up	version	of	the	outside	world.	The	faceplate
patch	wasn’t	exactly	smooth	or	reflective.	Stil,	it	was	enough	to	see	what	was
going	on.

I	bee-lined	for	where	the	airlock	used	to	be.	I	knew	there	had	to	be	a	pretty	big
hole	there,	so	I’d	be	able	to	get	in.	I	found	it	easily.

And	boy	is	it	a	nasty	rip!	It’s	going	to	be	a	pain	in	the	ass	to	fix	it.

That’s	when	the	flaws	in	my	plan	started	to	reveal	themselves.	I	only	had	one
arm	to	work	with.	My	left	arm	was	pinned	against	my

body,	while	the	stumpy	arm	of	the	suit	bounced	freely.	So	as	I	moved	around
under	the	canvas,	I	had	to	use	my	one	good	arm	to	hold	the

canvas	up.	It	slowed	me	down.

From	what	I	could	see,	the	interior	of	the	Hab	is	chaos.	Everything’s	moved.
Entire	tables	and	bunks	are	meters	away	from	where	they

started.	Lighter	objects	are	wildly	jumbled,	many	of	them	out	on	the	surface.
Everything’s	covered	in	soil	and	mangled	potato	plants.

Trudging	onward,	I	got	to	where	I’d	left	Martinez’s	suit.	To	my	shock,	it	was	stil
there!

“Yay!”	I	naively	thought.	“Problem	solved.”

Unfortunately,	the	suit	was	pinned	under	a	table,	which	was	held	down	by	the
colapsed	canvas.	If	I’d	had	both	arms,	I	could	have

puled	it	free,	but	with	only	one	I	just	couldn’t	do	it.

Running	low	on	time,	I	detached	the	helmet.	Setting	it	aside,	I	reached	past	the
table	to	get	Martinez’s	patch	kit.	I	found	it	with	the	help	of	the	arm-camera.	I
dropped	it	in	the	helmet	and	hauled	ass	out	of	there.

Stumbling	to	the	rover,	I	barely	made	it	in	time.	My	ears	were	popping	from
pressure	loss	just	as	the	rover’s	airlock	filed	with

wonderful	1-atmosphere	air.

Crawling	in,	I	colapsed	and	panted	for	a	moment.

So	I’m	back	in	the	rover.	Just	like	I	was	back	on	the	Great	Pathfinder	Recovery
Expedition.	Ugh.	At	least	this	time	it	smels	a	little

better.

NASA’s	probably	pretty	worried	about	me	by	now.	They	probably	saw	the
airlock	move	back	to	the	Hab,	so	they	know	I’m	alive,

but	they’l	want	status.	And	as	it	happens,	it’s	the	rover	that	communicates	with
Pathfinder.

I	tried	to	send	a	message	but	Pathfinder	isn’t	responding.	That’s	not	a	big
surprise.	It’s	powered	directly	from	the	Hab,	and	the	Hab	is	offline.	During	my
brief,	panicked	scramble	outside,	I	saw	Pathfinder	was	right	where	I	left	it,	and
the	debris	didn’t	reach	that	far	out.	It	should	be	fine	once	I	get	it	some	power.

As	for	my	current	situation,	the	big	gain	is	the	helmet.	They’re	interchangeable,
so	I	can	replace	my	broken-ass	one	with	Martinez’s.

The	stumpy	arm	is	stil	an	issue,	but	the	faceplate	was	the	main	source	of	leaks.
And	with	the	fresh	patch	kit,	I	can	seal	the	arm	with	more	resin.

But	that	can	wait.	I’ve	been	awake	for	over	24	hours.	I’m	not	in	any	immediate
danger,	so	I’m	going	to	sleep.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	121

Got	a	good	night’s	sleep,	and	made	real	progress	today.

First	thing	I	did	was	re-seal	the	arm.	Last	time,	I	had	to	spread	the	resin	pretty
thin;	I’d	used	most	of	it	for	the	faceplate	patch.	But	this	time	I	had	a	whole	patch
kit	just	for	the	arm.	I	got	a	perfect	seal.

I	stil	only	had	a	one-armed	suit,	but	at	least	it	didn’t	leak.

I’d	lost	most	of	my	air	yesterday,	but	I	had	a	half-hour	of	oxygen	left.	Like	I	said

earlier,	a	human	body	doesn’t	need	much	oxygen.

Maintaining	pressure	was	the	problem.

With	that	much	time,	I	was	able	to	take	advantage	of	the	rover’s	EVA	tank-refil.
Something	I	couldn’t	do	with	the	leaky	suit.

The	tank-refil	is	an	emergency	measure.	The	expected	use	of	the	rover	is	to	start
with	ful	EVA	suits	and	come	back	with	air	to	spare.

It	wasn’t	designed	for	long	trips,	or	even	overnighters.	But,	just	in	case	of
emergency,	it	has	refil	hoses	mounted	on	the	exterior.	Inside	space	was	limited
already,	and	NASA	concluded	most	air-related	emergencies	would	be	outdoors.

But	refiling	is	slow,	slower	than	my	suit	was	leaking.	So	it	wasn’t	any	use	to	me.
Now,	with	a	solid	suit	capable	of	holding	pressure,

refiling	the	tanks	was	a	breeze.

After	refiling,	and	making	sure	the	suit	was	stil	not	leaking,	I	had	a	few
immediate	tasks	to	take	care	of.	Much	as	I	trust	my	handiwork,	I	wanted	a	two-
armed	suit.

I	ventured	back	in	to	the	Hab.	This	time,	not	being	rushed,	I	was	able	to	use	a
pole	to	leverage	the	table	off	Martinez’s	suit.	Puling	it	loose,	I	dragged	it	back	to
the	rover.

After	a	thorough	diagnostic	to	be	sure,	I	finaly	had	a	fuly-functional	EVA	suit!	It
took	me	two	trips	to	get	it,	but	I	got	it.

Tomorrow,	I'l	fix	the	Hab.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	122

The	first	thing	I	did	today	was	line	up	rocks	near	the	rover	to	spel	“A-OK”.	That
should	make	NASA	happy.

I	went	in	to	the	Hab	again	to	assess	damage.	My	priority	wil	be	to	get	the
structure	intact	and	holding	pressure.	From	there,	I	can	work	on	fixing	stuff	that
broke.

The	Hab	is	normaly	a	dome,	with	flexible	support	poles	maintaining	the	arch,
and	rigid,	folding	floor	material	to	keep	it	flat.	The	internal	pressure	was	a	vital
part	of	its	support.	Without	it,	the	whole	thing	colapsed.	I	inspected	the	poles,
and	none	of	them	had	broken.	They’re	just	lying	flat	is	al.	I’l	have	to	re-couple	a
few	of	them,	but	that’l	be	easy.

The	hole	where	Airlock	1	used	to	be	is	huge,	but	surmountable.	I	have	seal-strips
and	spare	canvas.	It’l	be	a	lot	of	work,	but	I	can	get	the	Hab	together	again.	Once
I	do,	I’l	re-establish	power	and	get	Pathfinder	back	online.	From	there,	NASA
can	tel	me	how	to	fix

anything	I	can’t	figure	out	on	my	own.

I’m	not	worried	about	any	of	that.	I	have	a	much	bigger	problem.

The	farm	is	dead.

With	a	complete	loss	of	pressure,	most	of	the	water	boiled	off.	Also,	the
temperature	is	wel	below	freezing.	Not	even	the	bacteria	in

the	soil	can	survive	a	catastrophe	like	that.	Some	of	the	crops	were	in	pop-tents
off	the	Hab.	But	they’re	dead,	too.	I	had	them	connected	directly	to	the	Hab	via
hoses	to	maintain	air	supply	and	temperature.	When	the	Hab	blew,	the	pop-tents
depressurized	as	wel.	Even	if	they	hadn’t,	the	freezing	cold	would	have	kiled
them.

Potatoes	are	now	extinct	on	Mars.

So	are	earthworms	and	soil	bacteria.	I’l	never	grow	another	plant	so	long	I’m
here.

We	had	it	al	planned	out.	My	farm	would	give	me	food	til	Sol	900.	A	supply
probe	would	get	here	on	Sol	856;	way	before	I	ran	out.

With	the	farm	dead,	that	plan	is	history.

The	ration	packs	won’t	have	been	affected	by	the	explosion.	And	the	potatoes
may	be	dead,	but	they’re	stil	food.	I	was	just	about	to

harvest,	so	it	was	a	good	time	for	this	to	happen,	I	guess.

The	rations	wil	last	me	til	Sol	400.	I	can’t	say	for	sure	how	long	the	potatoes	wil
last	until	I	see	how	many	I	got.	But	I	can	estimate.	I	had	400	plants,	probably
averaging	5	potatoes	each:	2000	taters.	At	150	calories	each,	I’l	need	to	eat	10
per	sol	to	survive.	That	means	they’l	last	me	200	sols.	Grand	total:	I	have
enough	food	to	last	til	Sol	600.

By	Sol	856	I’l	be	long	dead.

Project	Iris

[08:12]WATNEY:	Test.

[08:25]JPL:	Received!	You	gave	us	quite	a	scare	there.	Thanks	for	the	“A-OK”

message.	Our	analysis	of	satellite	imagery	shows	a	complete	detachment	of
Airlock

1.	Is	that	correct?	What’s	your	status?	Include	your	personal	health	and	Hab

equipment.

[08:39]WATNEY:	If	by	“detachment”	you	mean	“shot	me	out	like	a	cannon”
then	yeah.

Minor	cut	on	my	forehead.	Had	some	issues	with	my	EVA	suit	(I’ll	explain
later).	I

patched	up	the	Hab	and	repressurized	it	(main	air	tanks	were	intact).	I	just	got

power	back	online.	Primary	air	and	water	tanks	were	unharmed.	The	rover,	solar

array,	and	Pathfinder	were	out	of	blast	range.	I’ll	run	diagnostics	on	the	Hab’s

systems	while	I	wait	for	your	next	reply.	By	the	way,	who	am	I	talking	to?

[08:52]JPL:	Venkat	Kapoor,	in	Houston.	Pasadena	relays	my	messages.	I'm
going	to

handle	all	direct	communication	with	you	from	now	on.	Check	the	Oxygenator
and

Water	Reclaimer	first.	They’re	the	most	important.

[09:05]WATNEY:	Duh.	Oxygenator	functioning	perfectly.	Water	Reclaimer	is

completely	offline.	Best	guess	is	water	froze	up	inside	and	burst	some	tubing.
I’m

sure	I	can	fix	it.	Hab’s	main	computer	also	functioning	without	any	problems.
Any

idea	what	caused	the	Hab	to	blow	up?

[09:18]JPL:	Best	guess	is	fatigue	on	the	canvas	near	Airlock	1.	The

pressurization	cycle	stressed	it	until	it	failed.	From	now	on,	alternate	Airlock	2

and	3	for	all	EVAs.	Also,	we’ll	be	getting	you	a	checklist	and	procedures	for	a

full	canvas	exam.

[09:31]WATNEY:	Yay,	I	get	to	stare	at	a	wall	for	several	hours!	By	the	way,	the

farm	is	dead.	I’ve	recovered	as	many	potatoes	as	I	could	and	stored	them
outside.	I

count	1841.	That	will	last	me	184	days.	Including	the	remaining	mission	rations,

I’ll	start	starving	on	Sol	584.

[09:44]JPL:	Yeah,	we	figured.	Working	on	it.

“It’s	Sol	122,”	Bruce	said.	“We	have	until	Sol	584	to	get	a	probe	to	Mars.	That’s
462	sols,	which	is	475	days.”

The	assembled	department	heads	of	JPL	furrowed	their	brows	and	rubbed	their
eyes.

“First	they	needed	a	presupply	way	ahead	of	schedule,”	Bruce	continued.	“Now
they	need	it	even	more	ahead	of	schedule.”

He	stood	from	his	chair.	“The	positions	of	Earth	and	Mars	aren’t	ideal.	The	trip
wil	take	414	days.	Mounting	the	probe	to	the	booster

and	dealing	with	inspections	wil	take	13	days.	That	leaves	us	with	just	48	days	to
make	this	probe.”

Sounds	of	whispered	exasperation	filed	the	room.	“Jesus,”	someone	said.

“It's	a	whole	new	balgame,”	Bruce	continued.	“Our	focus	is	food.	Anything	else
is	a	luxury.	We	don't	have	time	to	make	a	powered-

descent	lander.	It'l	have	to	be	a	tumbler.	So	we	can't	put	anything	delicate	inside.
Say	goodbye	to	the	al	the	other	crap	we'd	planned	to	send.”

“Where's	the	booster	coming	from?”asked	Norm	Toshi,	who	was	in	charge	of	the
reentry	process.

“The	EagleEye	3	Saturn	probe,”	Bruce	said.	“It	was	scheduled	to	launch	next
month.	NASA	put	it	on	hold	so	we	can	have	the

booster.”

“I	bet	the	EagleEye	team	was	pissed	about	that,”	Norm	said.

“I'm	sure	they	were,”	Bruce	said.	“But	it's	the	only	booster	we	have	that's	big
enough.	Which	brings	me	to	my	next	point:	We	only	get

one	shot	at	this.	If	we	fuck	it	up,	Mark	Watney	dies.”

He	looked	around	the	room	and	let	that	sink	in.

“We	do	have	some	things	going	for	us,”	he	finaly	said.	“We	have	some	of	the
parts	built	for	the	Ares	4	presupply	missions.	We	can

steal	from	them,	and	that'l	save	us	some	time.	Also,	we're	sending	food,	which	is
pretty	robust.	Even	if	there's	a	reentry	problem	and	the	probe	impacts	at	high
velocity,	food	is	stil	food.

“And	we	don't	need	a	precision	landing.	Watney	can	travel	hundreds	of
kilometers	if	necessary.	We	just	need	to	land	close	enough	for

him	to	reach	it.	This	ends	up	being	a	standard	tumble-land	presupply.	Al	we	have
to	do	is	make	it	quickly.	So	let's	get	to	it.”

[08:02]JPL:	We've	spun	up	a	project	to	get	you	food.	It's	been	in	progress	for	a

week	or	so.	We	can	get	it	to	you	before	you	starve,	but	it'll	be	tight.	It'll	just

be	food	and	a	radio.	We	can't	send	an	Oxygenator,	Water	Reclaimer,	or	any	of
that

other	stuff	without	powered	descent.

[08:16]WATNEY:	No	complaints	here!	You	get	me	the	food,	I'll	be	a	happy
camper.

I've	got	all	Hab	systems	up	and	running	again.	The	Water	Reclaimer	is	working
fine

now	that	I	replaced	the	burst	hoses.	As	for	water	supply,	I	have	620L	remaining.
I

started	with	900L	(300	to	start	with,	600	more	from	reducing	hydrazine).	So	I
lost

almost	300L	to	sublimation.	Still,	with	the	Water	Reclaimer	operational	again,
it's

plenty.

[08:31]JPL:	Good,	keep	us	posted	on	any	mechanical	or	electronic	problems.	By
the

way,	the	name	of	the	probe	we're	sending	is	“Iris”.	Named	after	the	Greek
goddess

who	traveled	the	heavens	with	the	speed	of	wind.	She's	also	the	goddess	of

rainbows.

[08:47]WATNEY:	Gay	probe	coming	to	save	me.	Got	it.

Rich	Purnel	sipped	coffee	in	the	silent	building.	Only	his	cubicle	iluminated	the
otherwise	dark	room.	Continuing	with	his	computations,	he	ran	a	final	test	on	the
software	he'd	written.	It	passed.

With	a	relieved	sigh,	he	sank	back	in	his	chair.	Checking	the	clock	on	his
computer,	he	shook	his	head.	3:42am.

Being	an	astrodynamicist,	Rich	rarely	had	to	work	late.	His	job	was	to	find	the
exact	orbits	and	course	corrections	needed	for	any

given	mission.	Usualy,	it	was	one	of	the	first	parts	of	a	project;	al	the	other	steps
being	based	on	the	orbit.

But	this	time,	things	were	reversed.	Iris	needed	an	orbital	path,	and	nobody	knew
when	it	would	launch.	A	non-Hoffman	Mars-transfer

isn't	chalenging,	but	it	does	require	the	exact	locations	of	Earth	and	Mars.

Planets	move	as	time	goes	by.	A	course	calculated	for	a	specific	launch	date	wil
work	only	for	that	date.	Even	a	single	day's	difference	would	result	in	missing
Mars	entirely.

So	Rich	had	to	calculate	many	courses.	He	had	a	range	of	25	days	during	which
Iris	might	launch.	He	calculated	one	course	for	each.

He	began	an	email	to	his	boss.

Mike,	he	typed,	Attached	are	the	courses	for	Iris,	in	1-day	increments.	We	should
start	peer-review	and	vetting	so	they	can	be	officially	accepted.	And	you	were
right,	I	was	here	almost	all	night.

It	wasn't	that	bad.	Nowhere	near	the	pain	of	calculating	orbits	for	Hermes.	I
know	you	get	bored	when	I	go	in	to	the	math,	so

I'll	summarize:	The	small,	constant	thrust	of	Hermes's	ion	drives	is	much	harder
to	deal	with	than	the	large	point-thrusts	of

presupply	probes.

All	25	of	the	courses	take	414	days,	and	vary	only	slightly	in	thrust	duration	and
angle.	The	fuel	requirement	is	nearly

identical	for	the	orbits	and	is	well	within	the	capacity	of	EagleEye's	booster.

It's	too	bad.	Earth	and	Mars	are	really	badly	positioned.	Heck,	it's	almost	easier
to-

He	stopped	typing.

Furrowing	his	brow,	he	stared	in	to	the	distance.

“Hmm.”	he	said.

Grabbing	his	coffee	cup,	he	went	to	the	break	room	for	a	refil.

“I	know	you're	al	busy,”	Teddy	said,	“so	let's	make	this	fast.	I	need	status	on
Project	Iris	from	al	departments.	Venkat,	let's	start	with	you.”

“The	mission	team's	ready,”	Venkat	said.	“There	was	a	minor	turf	war	between
the	Ares-3	and	Ares-4	presupply	control	teams.	The

Ares-3	guys	said	they	should	run	it,	cause	while	Watney's	on	Mars,	Ares-3	is	stil
in	progress.	The	Ares-4	team	points	out	it's	their	co-

opted	probe	in	the	first	place.	I	ended	up	going	with	Ares-3.”

“Did	that	upset	Ares-4?”	Teddy	asked.

“Yeah,	but	they'l	get	over	it.	They	have	13	presupply	missions	coming	up.	They
won't	have	time	to	be	pissy.”

“Mitch,”	Teddy	said	to	the	flight	controler,	“What	about	the	launch?”

“We've	got	a	control	room	ready,”	Mitch	replied.	“I'l	oversee	the	launch,	then
hand	cruise	and	landing	over	to	Venkat's	guys.”

“Media?”	Teddy	said,	turning	to	Annie	Montrose.

“I'm	giving	daily	updates	to	the	press,”	she	said.	“Everyone	knows	Watney's
fucked	if	this	doesn't	work.	The	public	hasn't	been	this

engaged	in	ship	construction	since	Apolo	11.	CNN's	'The	Watney	Report'	has
been	the	#1	show	in	its	time-slot	for	the	past	two	weeks.”

“The	attention	is	good,”	Teddy	said.	“It'l	help	get	us	emergency	funding	from
Congress.	Maurice,	how's	the	booster?”

“It's	al	right	for	now,”	said	Maurice	Stein,	Director	of	Pad	Operations.	“But	it's

not	ideal.	EagleEye	3	was	set	to	launch.	Boosters

aren't	designed	to	stand	upright	and	bear	the	stress	of	gravity	for	long	periods.
We're	adding	external	supports	that	we'l	remove	before	launch.	It's	easier	than
disassembly.	Also	the	fuel	is	corrosive	to	the	internal	tanks,	so	we	had	to	drain	it.
In	the	mean	time,	we're	performing	inspections	on	al	systems	every	three	days.”

“Good,	good,”	Teddy	nodded.	“Now	for	the	big	question:	Bruce?	How's	Iris
coming	along?”

“We're	behind,”	Bruce	said	with	a	tired	shake	of	his	head.	“We're	going	as	fast	as
we	can,	but	it's	just	not	fast	enough.”

“I	can	find	money	for	overtime,”	Teddy	offered.

“We're	already	working	around	the	clock.”

“How	far	behind	are	we	walking	about?”	Teddy	asked.

“We've	been	at	it	29	days;	so	we	only	have	19	left,”	Bruce	explained.	“After	that,
the	Pad	needs	13	days	to	mount	it	on	the	booster.

We're	at	least	two	weeks	behind.”

“Is	that	as	far	behind	as	you're	going	to	get?”	Teddy	asked.	“Or	wil	you	slip
more?”

Bruce	shrugged.	“If	we	don't	have	any	more	problems,	it'l	be	two	weeks	late.	But
we	always	have	problems.”

“Give	me	a	number,”	Teddy	said.

“15	days,”	Bruce	responded.	“If	I	had	another	15	days,	I'm	sure	we	could	get	it
done	in	time.”

“Al	right,”	Teddy	said.	“Let's	create	15	days.”

Turning	his	attention	to	the	Ares-3	Flight	Surgeon,	Teddy	asked	“Dr.	Keler,	can
we	reduce	Watney's	food	intake	to	make	the	rations

last	longer?”

“Sorry,	but	no,”	Keler	said.	“he's	already	at	a	minimal	calorie	count.	In	fact,
considering	the	amount	of	physical	labor	he	does,	he's

eating	far	less	than	he	should.	And	it's	only	going	to	get	worse.	Soon	his	entire
diet	wil	be	potatoes	and	vitamin	supplements.	He's	been	saving	protein-rich
rations	for	later	use,	but	he'l	stil	be	malnourished.”

“Once	he	runs	out	of	food,	how	long	until	he	starves	to	death?”	Teddy	asked.

“Presuming	an	ample	water	supply,	he	might	last	three	weeks.	Shorter	than	a
typical	hunger	strike	but	remember	he'l	be	malnourished

and	thin	to	begin	with.”

“Remember,”	Venkat	interjected,	“Iris	is	a	tumbler;	he	might	have	to	drive	a	few
days	to	get	it.	And	I'm	guessing	it's	hard	to	control	a	rover	when	you're	literaly
starving	to	death.”

“He's	right,”	Dr.	Keler	confirmed.	“Within	4	days	of	running	out	of	food,	he'l
barely	be	able	to	stand	up,	let	alone	control	a	rover.	Plus,	his	mental	faculties	wil
rapidly	decline.	He'd	have	a	hard	time	even	staying	awake.”

“So	the	landing	date's	firm,”	Teddy	said.	“Maurice,	can	you	get	it	on	the	booster
in	less	than	13	days?”

Maurice	pondered.	“Wel...	It	only	takes	3	days	to	actualy	mount	it.	The	folowing
10	are	for	testing	and	inspections.”

“How	much	can	you	reduce	those?”

“With	enough	overtime,	I	could	get	the	mounting	down	to	2	days.	That	includes
transport	from	Pasadena	to	Cape	Canaveral.	But	the

inspections	can't	be	shortened.	They're	time-based.	We	do	checks	and	re-checks
with	set	intervals	between	them	to	see	if	something

deforms	or	warps.	If	you	shorten	the	intervals,	you	invalidate	the	inspections.”

“How	often	do	those	inspections	reveal	a	problem?”	Teddy	asked.

A	silence	fel	over	the	room.

“Uh,”	Maurice	stammered.	“Are	you	suggesting	we	don't	do	the	inspections?”

“No,”	said	Teddy.	“Right	now	I'm	asking	how	often	they	reveal	a	problem.”

“About	one	in	twenty	launches.”

“And	how	often	is	the	problem	they	reveal	a	would-be	mission-failure?”

“I'm,	uh,	not	sure.	Maybe	half	the	time?”

“So	if	we	skip	the	inspections	and	testing,	we	have	a	1	in	40	chance	of	mission
failure?”	Teddy	asked.

“That's	2.5%,”	Venkat	said,	steeping	in.	“Normaly,	that's	grounds	for	a
countdown	halt.	We	can't	take	a	chance	like	that.”

“	'Normaly'	was	a	long	time	ago,”	Teddy	said	calmly.	“97.5%	is	better	than	zero.
Can	anyone	think	of	a	safer	way	to	get	more	time?”

He	looked	around	the	table.	Blank	faces	stared	back.

“Al	right,	then.	Speeding	up	the	mounting	process	and	skipping	inspections	buys
us	11	days.	If	Bruce	can	pul	a	rabbit	out	of	a	hat	and

get	done	sooner,	Maurice	can	do	some	inspections.”

“What	about	the	other	4	days?”	Venkat	asked,	stil	frowning	at	skipping
inspections.

“I'm	sure	Watney	can	stretch	the	food	to	last	4	extra	days,	malnutrition
notwithstanding,”	Teddy	said,	looking	to	Dr.	Keler.

“I-”	Keler	started.	“I	can't	recommend-”

“Folks,”	Teddy	interrupted.	“I	understand	your	positions.	We	have	procedures.
Skipping	those	procedures	means	risk.	Risk	means

trouble	for	your	department.	But	now	isn't	the	time	to	cover	our	asses.	We	have
to	take	risks	or	Mark	Watney	dies.”

Turning	to	Keler,	he	said	“Make	the	food	last	another	4	days.”

Keler	nodded	silently.

“Rich,”	said	Mike.

Rich	Purnel	concentrated	on	his	computer	screen.	His	cubicle	was	a	landfil	of
printouts,	charts,	and	reference	books.	Empty	coffee

cups	rested	on	every	surface;	take-out	packaging	littered	the	ground.

“Rich,”	Mike	said,	more	forcefuly.

Rich	looked	up.	“Yeah?”

“What	the	hel	are	you	doing?”

“Just	a	little	side	project.	Something	I	wanted	to	check	up	on.”

“Wel...	that's	fine,	I	guess,”	Mike	said,	“but	you	need	to	do	your	assigned	work
first.	I	asked	for	those	satelite	adjustments	two	weeks	ago	and	you	stil	haven't
done	them.”

“I	need	some	supercomputer	time.”	Rich	said.

“You	need	supercomputer	time	to	calculate	routine	satelite	adjustments?”

“No,	it's	for	this	other	thing	I'm	working	on,”	Rich	said.

“Rich,	seriously.	You	have	to	do	your	job.”

Rich	thought	for	a	moment.	“Would	now	be	a	good	time	for	a	vacation?”	He
asked.

Mike	sighed.	“You	know	what,	Rich?	I	think	now	would	be	an	ideal	time	for	you
to	take	a	vacation.”

“Great!”	Rich	smiled.	“I'l	start	right	now.”

“Sure,”	Mike	said.	“Go	on	home.	Get	some	rest.”

“Oh,	I'm	not	going	home,”	said	Rich,	returning	to	his	calculations.

Mike	rubbed	his	eyes.	“Ok,	whatever.	About	those	satelite	orbits...?”

“I'm	on	vacation,”	Rich	said	without	looking	up.

Mike	shrugged	and	walked	away.

[08:01]WATNEY:	How's	my	care	package	coming	along?

[08:16]JPL:	A	little	behind	schedule,	but	we'll	get	it	done.	In	the	mean	time,	we

want	you	to	get	back	to	work.	We're	satisfied	the	Hab's	is	in	good	condition.

Maintenance	only	takes	you	12	hours	per	week.	We're	going	to	pack	the	rest	of
your

time	with	research	and	experiments.

[08:31]WATNEY:	Great!	I'm	sick	of	sitting	on	my	ass.	I'm	going	to	be	here	for

years.	You	may	as	well	make	use	of	me.

[08:47]JPL:	That's	what	we're	thinking.	We'll	get	you	a	schedule	as	soon	as	the

science	team	puts	it	together.	It'll	be	mostly	of	EVAs,	geological	samples,	soil

tests,	and	weekly	self-administered	medical	tests.	Honestly,	this	is	the	best

“bonus	Mars	time”	we've	had	since	the	Opportunity	lander.

[09:02]WATNEY:	Opportunity	never	went	back	to	Earth.

[09:17]JPL:	Sorry.	Bad	analogy.

The	Whiteroom	was	abuzz	with	activity	as	technicians	sealed	Iris	in	to	the
specialy-designed	shipping	container.

The	other	two	shifts	watched	from	the	observation	deck.	They	had	rarely	seen
their	own	homes	in	two	months;	a	makeshift	bunkroom

had	been	set	up	in	the	cafeteria.	Fuly	a	third	of	them	would	normaly	be	asleep	at
this	hour,	but	they	did	not	want	to	miss	this	moment.

The	shift	leader	tightened	the	final	bolt.	As	he	retracted	the	wrench,	the
engineers	broke	in	to	applause.	Many	of	them	were	in	tears.

After	62	days	of	grueling	work,	Iris	was	complete.

“The	launch	preparations	are	complete,”	Annie	Montrose	said	to	the	press	room.
“Iris	is	ready	to	go.	The	scheduled	launch	is	9:14am.

“Once	launched,	it	wil	stay	in	orbit	for	at	least	three	hours.	During	that	time,
mission	control	wil	gather	exact	telemetry	in	preparation	for	the	trans-Mars
injection	burn.	Once	that's	complete	the	mission	wil	be	handed	off	to	the	Ares-3
presupply	team,	who	wil	monitor	its

progress	over	the	folowing	months.	It	wil	take	414	days	to	reach	Mars.	”

“About	the	payload,”	a	reporter	asked,	“I	hear	there's	more	than	just	food?”

“That's	true,”Annie	smiled.	“We	alocated	100	grams	for	luxury	items.	There	are
some	handwritten	letters	from	Mark's	family,	a	note

from	the	President,	and	a	USB	drive	filed	with	music	from	al	ages.”

“Any	disco?”	someone	asked.

“No	disco,”	Annie	said,	as	chuckles	cascaded	through	the	room.

CNN's	Cathy	Warner	spoke	up	“If	this	launch	fails,	is	there	any	recourse	for
Watney?”

“There	are	risks	to	any	launch,”	Annie	said,	“but	we	don't	anticipate	problems.
The	weather	at	the	Cape	is	clear	with	warm

temperatures.	Conditions	couldn't	be	better.”

“Is	there	any	spending	limit	to	this	rescue	operation?”	another	reporter	asked.
“Some	people	are	beginning	to	ask	how	much	is	too

much.”

“It's	not	about	the	bottom	line,”	Annie	said,	prepared	for	the	question.	“It's	about
a	human	life	in	immediate	danger.	But	if	you	want	to	look	at	it	financialy,
consider	the	value	of	Mark	Watney's	extended	mission.	His	prolonged	mission
and	fight	for	survival	is	giving	us	more	knowledge	about	Mars	than	the	rest	of
the	Ares	program	combined.”

“Do	you	believe	in	God,	Venkat?”	Mitch	asked.

“Sure,	lots	of	'em,”	Venkat	said.	“I'm	Hindu.”

“Ask	'em	al	for	help	with	this	launch.”

“Wil	do.”

Mitch	stepped	forward	to	his	station	in	the	large	control	room.	He	glanced	at	the
many	screens	on	the	far	wal,	and	the	dozens	of

people	at	their	stations.

He	put	his	headset	on	and	said.	“This	is	the	Flight	Director.	Begin	Launch	Status
Check.”

“Roger	that,	Houston,”	came	the	reply	from	the	Launch	Control	Director	in
Florida.	“CLCDR	checking	al	stations	are	manned	and

systems	ready,”	he	broadcast,	“Give	me	a	go/no-go	for	launch.	Talker?”

“Go.”	came	the	response.

“Timer.”

“Go,”	Came	another	voice.

“QAM1.”

“Go.”

Resting	his	chin	on	his	hands,	Mitch	stared	at	the	center	screen.	It	showed	the
Pad	video	feed.	The	booster,	amid	cloudy	water	vapor

from	the	cooling	process,	stil	had	EagleEye3	stenciled	on	the	side.

“QAM2.”

“Go.”

“QAM3.”

“Go.”

Venkat	leaned	against	the	back	wal.	An	administrator,	his	job	was	done.	He
could	only	watch	and	hope.	His	gaze	fixated	on	the	far

wal's	displays.	In	his	mind	he	saw	the	numbers,	the	shift	juggling,	the	outright
lies	and	borderline	crimes	he'd	committed	to	put	this	mission	together.	It	would
al	be	worthwhile	if	it	worked.

“FSC.”

“Go.”

“Prop	1.”

“Go.”

Teddy	sat	in	the	VIP	observation	room	behind	mission	control.	His	authority
afforded	him	the	very	best	seat:	front-row	center.	His

briefcase	lay	at	his	feet	and	he	held	a	blue	folder	in	his	hands.

“Prop	2.”

“Go.”

“PTO.”

“Go.”

Annie	Montrose	paced	in	her	private	office	next	to	the	press	room.	Nine
televisions	mounted	to	the	wal	were	each	tuned	to	a	different

network;	each	network	showed	the	launch	pad.	A	glance	at	her	computer	showed
foreign	networks	doing	the	same.	The	world	was

holding	its	breath.

“ACC.”

“Go.”

“LWO.”

“Go.”

Bruce	Ng	sat	in	the	JPL	cafeteria	along	with	hundreds	of	engineers	who	had
given	everything	they	had	to	Iris.	They	watched	the	large

TV	with	rapt	attention.	It	was	6:13am	in	Pasadena,	yet	every	single	employee
was	present.

“AFLC.”

“Go.”

“Guidance.”

“Go.”

Milions	of	kilometers	away,	the	crew	of	Hermes	listened	as	they	crowded	around
Johanssen's	station.	The	2-minute	transmission	time

didn't	matter.	They	had	no	way	to	help;	there	was	no	need	to	interact.	Johanssen
stared	intently	at	her	screen,	which	displayed	only	the	audio	signal	strength.
Beck	wrung	his	hands.	Vogel	stood	motionless,	his	eyes	fixed	on	the	floor.
Martinez	prayed	silently	at	first,	then	saw	no	reason	to	hide	it.	Commander
Lewis	stood	apart,	her	arms	folded	across	her	chest.

“PTC.”

“Go.”

“Launch	Vehicle	Director.”

“Go.”

“Houston,	this	is	Launch	Control,	we	are	go	for	launch.”

“Roger,”	Mitch	said	checking	the	countdown.	“This	is	Flight,	we	are	go	for
launch	on	schedule.”

“Roger	that	Houston,”	Launch	Control	said,	“Launch	on	schedule.”

Once	the	clock	reached	-00:00:15,	the	television	networks	got	what	they	were
waiting	for.	The	Timer	Controler	began	the	verbal

countdown.	“15,”	She	said.	“14...	13...	12...	11...”

Thousands	had	gathered	at	Cape	Canaveral;	the	largest	crowd	ever	to	watch	an
unmanned	launch.	They	listened	to	the	Timer

Controler's	voice	as	it	echoed	across	the	grandstands.

“10...	9...	8...	7...”

Rich	Purnel,	entrenched	in	his	orbital	calculations,	had	lost	track	of	time.	He
didn't	notice	when	his	coworkers	migrated	to	the	large

meeting	room	where	a	TV	had	been	set	up.	In	the	back	of	his	mind,	he	thought
the	office	was	unusualy	quiet,	but	he	gave	it	no	further

thought.

“6...	5...	4...”

“Ignition	sequence	start.”

“3...	2...	1...”

Clamps	released;	the	booster	rose	amid	a	plume	of	smoke	and	fire,	slowly	at
first,	then	racing	ever	faster.	The	assembled	crowd

cheered	it	on	its	way.

“...and	liftoff	of	the	Iris	Supply	Probe,”	the	Timer	Controler	said.

As	the	booster	soared,	Mitch	had	no	time	to	watch	the	spectacle	on	the	main

screen.	“Trim?”	He	caled	out.

“Trim's	good,	Flight.”	came	the	immediate	response.

“Course?”	He	asked.

“On	course.”

“Altitude	1000	meters,”	someone	said.

“We've	reached	safe-abort,”	another	person	caled	out,	indicating	that	the	ship
could	crash	harmlessly	into	the	Atlantic	Ocean	if

necessary.

“Altitude	1500	meters.”

“Pitch	and	rol	maneuver	commencing.”

“Getting	a	little	shimmy,	flight.”

Mitch	looked	over	to	the	Ascent	Flight	Director.	“Say	again?”

“A	slight	shimmy.	On-board	guidance	is	handling	it.”

“Keep	an	eye	on	it,”	Mitch	said.

“Altitude	2500	meters.”

“Pitch	and	rol	complete,	22	seconds	til	staging.”

The	quick	yet	thorough	design	of	Iris	accounted	for	catastrophic	landing	failure.
Rather	than	normal	meal	kits,	most	of	the	food	was

cubed	protein	bar	material.	Even	if	Iris	failed	to	deploy	its	tumble	baloons	and
impacted	at	hundreds	of	kph,	the	protein	cubes	would	stil	be	edible.

An	unmanned	mission,	there	was	no	cap	on	acceleration.	The	contents	of	the
probe	endured	forces	no	human	could	survive.	While

NASA	had	tested	the	effects	of	extreme	G-forces	on	protein	cubes,	they	had	not

done	so	with	a	simultaneous	lateral	vibration.	Had	they

been	given	more	time,	they	would	have.

The	harmless	shimmy,	caused	by	a	minor	fuel	mixture	imbalance,	rattled	the
payload.	Mounted	by	strong	bolts,	Iris	held	firm.	The

protein	cubes	inside	did	not.

The	thrust	compressed	the	food	while	the	shimmy	rattled	it.	An	effect	similar	to
liquefaction	during	an	earthquake	transformed	the

protein	cubes	into	a	thick	sludge.	Stored	in	a	compartment	that	originaly	had	no
left-over	space,	the	now-compressed	substance	had	room

to	slosh.

The	shimmy	also	caused	an	imbalanced	load,	forcing	the	sludge	toward	the	edge
of	its	compartment.	The	shift	in	weight	only	aggravated

the	problem	and	the	shimmy	grew	stronger.

“Shimmy's	getting	violent,”	reported	the	Ascent	Flight	Director.

“How	violent?”	Mitch	said.

“More	than	we	like,”	he	said.	“But	the	accelerometers	caught	it	and	calculated
the	new	center	of	mass.	The	guidance	computer	is

adjusting	the	engines'	thrusts	to	counteract.	We're	stil	good.”

“Keep	me	posted,”	Mitch	said.

“13	seconds	til	staging.”

The	unexpected	weight	shift	had	not	speled	disaster.	Al	systems	were	designed
for	worst-case	scenarios;	each	did	their	job	admirably.

The	ship	continued	toward	orbit	with	only	a	minor	course	adjustment,
implemented	automaticaly	by	sophisticated	software.

The	first	stage	depleted	its	fuel,	and	the	booster	coasted	for	a	fraction	of	a	second
as	it	jettisoned	stage-clamps	via	explosive	bolts.	The	now-empty	stage	fel	away
from	the	craft	as	the	second-stage	engines	prepared	to	ignite.

The	brutal	forces	had	disappeared.	The	protein	sludge	floated	free	in	the
container.	Given	two	seconds,	it	would	have	re-expanded	and

solidified.	But	it	was	given	only	a	quarter-second.

As	the	second	stage	fired,	the	craft	experienced	a	sudden	jolt	of	immense	force.
No	longer	contending	with	the	dead-weight	of	the	first

stage,	the	acceleration	was	profound.	The	300kg	of	sludge	slammed	in	to	the
back	of	its	container.	The	point	of	impact	was	at	the	edge	of	Iris,	nowhere	near
where	the	mass	was	expected	to	be.

Though	Iris	was	held	in	place	by	five	large	bolts,	the	force	was	directed	entirely
to	a	single	one.	The	bolt	was	designed	to	withstand

immense	forces;	if	necessary	to	carry	the	entire	weight	of	the	payload.	But	it	was
not	designed	to	sustain	a	sudden	impact	from	a	loose	300kg	mass.

The	bolt	sheared.	The	burden	was	then	shifted	to	the	remaining	four	bolts.	The
forceful	impact	having	passed,	their	work	was

considerably	easier	than	that	of	their	falen	comrade.

Had	the	pad	crew	been	given	time	to	do	normal	inspections,	they	would	have
noticed	the	minor	defect	in	one	of	the	bolts.	A	defect	that

slightly	weakened	it,	though	would	not	cause	failure	on	a	normal	mission.	Stil,
they	would	have	swapped	it	out	with	a	perfect	replacement.

The	off-center	load	presented	unequal	force	to	the	four	remaining	bolts,	the
defective	one	bearing	the	brunt	of	it.	Soon,	it	failed	as	wel.

From	there,	the	other	three	failed	in	rapid	succession.

Iris	slipped	from	its	supports	in	the	payload	bulb,	slamming	in	to	the	hul.

“Woah!”	exclaimed	the	Ascent	Flight	Director.	“Flight,	we're	getting	a	large
precession!”

“What?”	Mitch	said	as	alerts	beeped	and	lights	flashed	across	al	the	consoles.

“Force	on	Iris	is	at	7	G's,”	someone	said.

“Intermittent	signal	loss,”	came	another	voice.

“Ascent,	What's	happening	here?”	Mitch	demanded.

“Al	hel	broke	loose.	It's	spinning	on	the	long	axis	with	a	17	degree	precession.”

“How	bad?”

“At	least	5	rps,	and	faling	off	course.”

“Can	you	get	it	to	orbit?”

“I	can't	talk	to	it	at	al;	signal	failures	left	and	right.”

“Comm!”	Mitch	shot	to	the	Communications	Director.

“Workin'	on	it,	Flight,”	came	the	response.	“There's	a	problem	with	the	onboard
system.”

“Getting	some	major	G's	inside,	Flight.”

“Ground	telemetry	shows	it	200	meters	low	of	target	path.”

“We've	lost	readings	on	the	probe,	Flight.”

Mitch	zeroed	in	on	that	last	comment.	“Entirely	lost	the	probe?”	Mitch	asked.

“Affirm,	Flight.	Intermittent	signal	from	the	ship,	but	no	probe.”

“Shit,”	Mitch	said.	“It	shook	loose	in	the	bay.”

“It's	dradeling,	Flight.”

“Can	it	limp	to	orbit?”	Mitch	said.	“Even	super-low	EO?	We	might	be	able	to-”

“Loss	of	signal,	Flight.”

“LOS	here,	too.”

“Same	here.”

Other	than	the	alarms,	the	room	fel	silent.

After	a	moment,	Mitch	said	“Reestablish?”

“No	luck,”	said	Comm.

“Ground?”	Mitch	asked.

“GC,”	same	the	reply,	“Vehicle	had	already	left	visual	range.”

“SatCon?”	Mitch	asked.

“No	satelite	acquisition	of	signal.”

Mitch	looked	forward	to	the	main	screen.	It	was	black	now,	with	large	white
letters	reading	“LOS”.

“Flight,”	came	a	voice	over	the	radio,	“US	Destroyer	Stockton	reports	debris
faling	from	the	sky.	Source	matches	last	known	location

of	Iris.”

Mitch	put	his	head	in	his	hands.	“Roger,”	he	said.

Then	he	uttered	the	words	every	Flight	Director	hopes	never	to	say:	“GC,	Flight.
Lock	the	doors.”

It	was	the	signal	to	start	post-failure	procedures.

From	the	VIP	observation	room,	Teddy	watched	the	despondent	Mission	Control
Center.	He	took	a	deep	breath,	then	let	it	out.	He

looked	forlornly	at	the	blue	folder,	which	contained	the	cheerful	speech	praising
a	perfect	launch.	Placing	it	in	his	briefcase,	he	then	extracted	the	red	folder	with
the	other	speech	in	it.

Venkat	sat	in	his	darkened	office.	He	never	decided	to	be	in	the	dark.	He'd	just
been	lost	in	thought	so	long	it	got	dark	around	him.

His	mobile	rang.	His	wife	again.	No	doubt	worried	about	him.	He	let	it	go	to
voice	mail.	He	just	couldn't	face	her.	Or	anyone.

A	brief	chime	came	from	his	computer.	Glancing	over,	he	saw	an	email	from
JPL.	A	relayed	message	from	Pathfinder:

[16:03]WATNEY:	How'd	the	launch	go?

Chapter	16

Martinez:

Dr.	Shields	says	I	need	to	write	personal	messages	to	each	of	the	crew.	She	says

it'll	keep	me	tethered	to	humanity.	I	think	it's	bullshit.	But	hey,	it's	an	order.

With	you,	I	can	be	blunt:

If	I	die,	I	need	you	to	check	on	my	parents.	They'll	want	to	hear	about	our	time

on	Mars	first-hand.	I'll	need	you	to	do	that.

It	won't	be	easy	talking	to	a	couple	about	their	dead	son.	It's	a	lot	to	ask;

that's	why	I'm	asking	you.	I'd	tell	you	you're	my	best	friend	and	stuff,	but	it

would	be	gay.

I'm	not	giving	up.	Just	planning	for	every	outcome.	It's	what	I	do.

Guo	Ming,	Director	of	the	China	National	Space	Administration,	examined	the
expansive	paperwork	at	his	desk.	In	the	old	days,	when

China	wanted	to	launch	a	rocket,	they	just	launched	it.	Now,	they	were	compeled
by	international	agreements	to	warn	other	nations	first.

It	was	a	requirement,	Guo	Ming	noted	to	himself,	that	did	not	apply	to	the
United	States.	To	be	fair,	the	Americans	publicly	announced

their	launch	schedules	wel	in	advance,	so	it	amounted	to	the	same.

He	walked	a	fine	line	filing	out	the	form:	Making	the	launch	date	and	flight	path
clear,	while	doing	everything	possible	to	“conceal	state	secrets.”

He	snorted	at	the	last	requirement.	“Ridiculous,”	he	mumbled.	The	Taiyang	Shen
had	no	strategic	or	military	value.	It	was	an

unmanned	probe	that	would	be	in	Earth	orbit	less	than	two	days.	After	that,	it
would	travel	to	a	solar	orbit	between	Mercury	and	Venus.	It	would	be	China's
first	heliology	probe	to	orbit	the	sun.

Yet,	the	State	Council	insisted	al	launches	be	shrouded	in	secrecy.	Even	launches
with	nothing	to	hide.	This	way,	other	nations	could

not	infer	from	lack	of	openness	which	launches	contained	classified	payloads.

A	knock	at	the	door	interrupted	his	paperwork.

“Come,”	Guo	Ming	said,	happy	for	the	interruption.

“Good	evening,	Sir,”	said	Under-Director	Zhu	Tao.

“Tao,	welcome	back.”

“Thank	you,	Sir.	It's	good	to	be	back	in	Beijing.”

“How	were	things	at	Jiuquan?”	asked	Guo	Ming.	“Not	too	cold,	I	hope?	I'l	never
understand	why	our	launch	complex	is	in	the	middle

of	the	Gobi	Desert.”

“It	was	cold,	yet	manageable,”	Zhu	Tao	said.

“And	how	are	launch	preparations	coming	along?”

“I	am	happy	to	report	they	are	al	on-schedule.”

“Excelent,”	Guo	Ming	smiled.

Zhu	Tao	sat	quietly,	staring	at	his	boss.

Guo	Ming	looked	expectantly	back	at	him,	but	Zhu	Tao	neither	stood	to	leave
nor	said	anything	further.

“Something	else,	Tao?”	Guo	Ming	asked.

“Mmm,”	Zhu	Tao	said,	“Of	course,	you've	heard	about	the	Iris	probe?”

“Yes,	I	did,”	Guo	frowned.	“Terrible	situation.	That	poor	man's	going	to	starve.”

“Possibly,”	Zhu	Tao	said.	“Possibly	not.”

Guo	Ming	leaned	back	in	his	chair.	“What	are	you	saying?”

“It's	the	Taiyang	Shen's	booster,	Sir.	Our	engineers	have	run	the	numbers,	and	it
has	enough	fuel	for	a	Mars	injection	orbit.	It	could	get	there	in	419	days.”

“Are	you	kidding?”

“Have	you	ever	known	me	to	'kid,'	Sir?”

Guo	Ming	stood	and	pinched	his	chin.	Pacing,	he	said	“We	can	realy	send	a
probe	to	Mars?”

“It's	hardly	notable,	Sir,”	Zhu	Tao	said.	“We've	sent	several	in	the	past.”

“Yes,	I	know,	but	we	could	realy	send	the	Taiyang	Shen?”

“No,	Sir,”	said	Zhu	Tao.	“It's	far	too	heavy.	The	massive	heat	shielding	makes	it
the	heaviest	unmanned	probe	we've	ever	built.	That's

why	the	booster	had	to	be	so	powerful.	But	a	lighter	payload	could	be	sent	al	the
way	to	Mars.”

“How	much	mass	could	we	send?”	Guo	Ming	asked.

“941	kilograms,	Sir.”

“Hmm,”	Guo	Ming	said,	“I	bet	NASA	could	work	with	that	limitation.	Why
haven't	they	approached	us?”

“Because	they	don't	know.”	Zhu	Tao	said.	“Al	our	booster	technology	is
classified	information.	The	Ministry	of	State	Security	even

spreads	disinformation	about	our	capabilities.	This	is	for	obvious	reasons.”

“So	they	don't	know	we	can	help	them,”	Guo	Ming	said,	“If	we	decide	not	to
help,	no	one	wil	know	we	could	have.”

“Correct,	Sir.”

“For	the	sake	of	argument,	let's	say	we	decided	to	help.	What	then?”

“Time	would	be	the	enemy,	Sir,”	Zhu	Tao	answered.	“Based	on	travel	duration
and	the	supplies	their	astronaut	has	remaining,	any	such

probe	would	have	to	be	launched	within	a	month.	Even	then	he	would	starve	a
little.”

“That's	right	around	when	we	planned	to	launch	Taiyang	Shen.”

“Yes,	Sir.	But	it	took	them	two	months	to	build	Iris,	and	it	was	so	rushed	it
failed.”

“That's	their	problem,”	Guo	Ming	said.	“Our	end	would	be	providing	the
booster.	We'd	launch	from	Jiuquan;	we	can't	ship	an	800-ton

rocket	to	Florida.”

“Any	agreement	would	hinge	on	the	Americans	reimbursing	us	for	the	booster,”
Zhu	Tao	said,	“and	the	State	Council	would	likely	want

political	favors	from	the	US	Government.”

“Reimbursement	would	be	pointless,”	Guo	Ming	said.	“This	was	an	expensive
project,	and	the	State	Council	grumbled	about	it	al

along.	If	they	had	a	bulk	payout	for	it's	value,	they'd	just	keep	it.	We'd	never	get
to	build	another	one.”

He	clasped	his	hands	behind	his	back.	“And	the	American	people	may	be
sentimental,	but	their	government	is	not.	The	US	State

Department	won't	trade	anything	major	for	one	man's	life.”

“So	it's	hopeless?”	asked	Zhu	Tao.

“Not	hopeless,”	Guo	Ming	corrected.	“Just	hard.	If	this	becomes	a	negotiation
by	diplomats,	it	wil	never	resolve.	We	need	to	keep	this

among	scientists.	Space	agency	to	space	agency.	I'l	get	a	translator	and	cal
NASA's	Director.	We'l	work	out	an	agreement,	then	present

it	to	our	governments	as	a	fait	accompli.”

“But	what	can	they	do	for	us?”	Zhu	Tao	asked.	“We'd	be	giving	up	a	booster	and
effectively	canceling	Taiyang	Shen.	”

Guo	Ming	smiled.	“They'l	give	us	something	we	can't	get	without	them.”

“And	that	is?”

“They'l	put	a	Chinese	astronaut	on	Mars.”

Zhu	Tao	stood.	“Of	course,”	he	smiled.	“The	Ares	5	crew	hasn't	even	been
selected	yet.	We'l	insist	on	a	crewman.	One	we	get	to	pick

and	train.	NASA	and	the	US	State	Department	would	surely	accept	that.	But	wil
our	State	Council?”

Guo	Ming	smiled	wryly.	“Publicly	rescue	the	Americans?	Put	a	Chinese
astronaut	on	Mars?	Have	the	world	see	China	as	equal	to	the

US	in	space?	The	State	Council	would	sel	their	own	mothers	for	that.”

Teddy	listened	to	the	phone	at	his	ear.	The	voice	on	the	other	end	finished	what	it
had	to	say,	then	fel	silent	as	it	awaited	an	answer.

He	stared	at	nothing	in	particular	as	he	processed	what	he'd	just	heard.

After	a	few	seconds,	he	replied	“Yes.”

Johanssen:

Your	poster	outsold	the	rest	of	ours	combined.	You're	a	hot	chick	who	went	to

Mars.	You're	on	dorm-room	walls	all	over	the	world.

Looking	like	that,	why	are	you	such	a	nerd?	And	you	are,	you	know.	A	serious

nerd.	I	had	to	do	some	computer	shit	to	get	Pathfinder	talking	to	the	rover	and	oh

my	God.	And	I	had	NASA	telling	me	what	to	do	every	step	of	the	way.

You	should	try	to	be	more	cool.	Wear	dark	glasses	and	a	leather	jacket.	Carry	a

switchblade.	Aspire	to	a	level	of	coolness	known	only	as...	“Botanist	Cool.”

Did	you	know	Commander	Lewis	had	a	chat	with	us	men?	If	anyone	hit	on	you,
we'd

be	off	the	mission.	I	guess	after	a	lifetime	of	commanding	sailors	she's	got	an

unfairly	jaded	view.

Anyway.	Try	not	to	think	about	all	those	guys	wanking	to	your	poster.

“Ok,	here	we	are	again,”	said	Bruce	to	the	assembled	heads	of	JPL.	“You've	al
heard	about	the	Taiyang	Shen,	so	you	know	our

friends	in	China	have	given	us	one	more	chance.	But	this	time,	it's	going	to	be
harder.

“Taiyang	Shen	wil	be	ready	to	launch	in	28	days.	If	it	launches	on	time,	our
payload	wil	get	to	Mars	on	Sol	624,	six	weeks	after

Watney's	expected	to	run	out	of	food.	NASA's	already	working	on	ways	to
stretch	his	supply.

“We	made	history	when	we	finished	Iris	in	sixty	three	days.	Now	we	have	to	do
it	in	twenty	eight.	”

He	looked	across	the	table	to	the	incredulous	faces.

“Folks,”	he	said,	“This	is	going	to	be	the	most	'ghetto'	spacecraft	ever	built.
There's	only	one	way	to	finish	that	fast:	No	landing	system.”

“Sorry,	what?”	Jack	Trevor	stammered.

Bruce	nodded.	“You	heard	me.	No	landing	system.	We'l	need	guidance	for	in-
flight	course	adjustments.	But	once	it	gets	to	Mars,	it's

going	to	crash.”

“That's	crazy!”	Jack	said.	“It'l	be	going	an	insane	velocity	when	it	hits!”

“Yep,”	Bruce	said.	“With	ideal	atmospheric	drag,	it'l	impact	at	300	meters	per
second.”

“What	good	wil	a	pulverized	probe	do	Watney?”	Jack	asked.

“As	long	as	the	food	doesn't	burn	up	on	the	way	in,	Watney	can	eat	it.”	Bruce
commented.

Turning	to	the	whiteboard,	he	began	drawing	a	basic	organizational	chart	.	“I
want	two	teams,”	He	began.

“Team	One	wil	make	the	outer	shel,	guidance	system,	and	thrusters.	Al	we	need
is	for	it	to	get	to	Mars.	I	want	the	safest	possible

system.	Aerosol	propelant	would	be	best.	High-gain	radio	so	we	can	talk	to	it,
and	standard	satelite	navigational	software.

“Team	Two	wil	deal	with	the	payload.	They	need	to	find	a	way	to	contain	the
food	during	impact.	If	protein	bars	hit	sand	at	300m/s,

they'l	make	protein-scented	sand.	We	need	them	edible	after	impact.

“We	can	weigh	941kg.	At	least	300	of	that	needs	to	be	food.	Get	crackin'.”

“Uh,	Dr.	Kapoor?”	Rich	said,	peeking	his	head	in	to	Venkat's	office.	“Do	you
have	a	minute?”

Venkat	gestured	him	in.	“You	are...?”

“Rich,	Rich	Purnel,”	he	said,	shuffling	in	to	the	office,	his	arms	wrapped	around
a	sheaf	disorganized	papers.	“From	astrodynamics.”

“Nice	to	meet	you,”	Venkat	said.	“What	can	I	do	for	you,	Rich?”

“I	came	up	with	something	a	while	ago.	Spent	a	lot	of	time	on	it.”	He	dumped
the	papers	on	Venkat's	desk.	“Lemme	find	the

summary...”

Venkat	stared	forlornly	at	his	once	clean	desk,	now	strewn	with	scores	of
printouts.

“Here	we	go!”	Rich	said	triumphantly,	grabbing	a	paper.	Then,	his	expression
saddened.	“No,	this	isn't	it.”

“Rich,”	Venkat	said.	“Maybe	you	should	just	tel	me	what	this	is	about?”

Rich	looked	at	the	mess	of	papers	and	sighed.	“But	I	had	such	a	cool
summary...”

“A	summary	for	what?”

“How	to	save	Watney.”

“That's	already	in	progress,”	Venkat	said.	“It's	a	last-ditch	effort,	but-”

“The	Taiyang	Shen?”	Rich	snorted.	“That	won't	work.	You	can't	make	a	Mars
probe	in	a	month.”

“We're	sure	as	hel	going	to	try,”	Venkat	said,	a	note	of	annoyance	in	his	voice.

“Oh	sorry,	am	I	being	difficult?”	Rich	asked.	“I'm	not	good	with	people.
Sometimes	I'm	difficult.	I	wish	people	would	just	tel	me.

Anyway,	the	Taiyang	Shen	is	critical.	In	fact,	my	idea	won't	work	without	it.	But
a	Mars	probe?	Pfft.	C'mon.”

“Al	right,”	Venkat	said.	“What's	your	idea?”

Rich	snatched	a	paper	from	the	desk.	“Here	it	is!”	He	handed	it	to	Venkat	with	a
child-like	smile.

Venkat	took	the	summary	and	skimmed	it.	The	more	he	read,	the	wider	his	eyes
got.	“Are	you	sure	about	this?”

“Absolutely!”	Rich	beamed.

“Have	you	told	anyone	else?”

“Who	would	I	tel?”

“I	don't	know,	Venkat	said.	“Friends?”

“I	don't	have	any	of	those.”

“Ok,	keep	it	under	your	hat.”	Venkat	said.

“I	don't	wear	a	hat.”

“It's	just	an	expression.”

“Realy?”	Rich	said.	“It's	a	stupid	expression.”

“Rich,	you're	being	difficult.”

“Ah.	Thanks.”

Vogel:

Being	your	backup	has	backfired.

I	guess	NASA	figured	botany	and	chemistry	are	similar	because	they	both	end	in

“Y”.	One	way	or	another,	I	ended	up	being	your	back-up	chemist.

Remember	when	they	made	you	spend	a	day	explaining	your	experiments	to
me?	It	was

in	the	middle	of	intense	mission	prep.	You	may	have	forgotten.

You	started	my	training	by	buying	me	a	beer.	For	breakfast.	Germans	are
awesome.

Anyway,	now	that	I	have	time	to	kill,	NASA	gave	me	a	pile	of	work.	And	all
your

chemistry	crap	is	on	the	list.	So	now	I	have	to	do	boring-ass	experiments	with
test

tubes	and	soil	and	pH	levels	and	Zzzzzzzzzz....

My	life	is	now	a	desperate	struggle	for	survival...	with	occasional	titration.

Frankly,	I	suspect	you're	a	super	villain.	You're	a	chemist,	you	have	a	German

accent,	you	had	a	base	on	Mars...	what	more	can	there	be?

“What	the	fuck	is	'Project	Elrond'?”	Annie	asked.

“I	had	to	make	something	up,”	Venkat	said.

“So	you	came	up	with	'Elrond'?”	Annie	pressed.

“Because	it's	a	secret	meeting?”	Mitch	guessed.	“The	email	said	I	couldn't	even
tel	my	assistant.”

“I'l	explain	everything	once	Teddy	arrives.”	Venkat	said.

“Why	does	'Elrond'	mean	'secret	meeting'?”	Annie	asked.

“Are	we	going	to	make	a	momentous	decision?”	Bruge	Ng	asked.

“Exactly,”	Venkat	said.

“How	did	you	know	that?”	Annie	asked,	getting	annoyed.

“Elrond,”	Bruce	said.	“The	Council	of	Elrond.	From	Lord	of	the	Rings.	It's	the
meeting	where	they	decide	to	destroy	The	One	Ring.”

“Jesus,”	Annie	said.	“None	of	you	got	laid	in	high	school,	did	you?”

“Good	morning,”	Teddy	said	as	he	walked	in.	Seating	himself,	he	rested	his
hands	on	the	table.	“Anyone	know	what	this	meeting's

about?”	He	asked.

“Wait,”	Mitch	said,	“Teddy	doesn't	even	know?”

Venkat	took	a	deep	breath.	“One	of	our	astrodynamicists,	Rich	Purnel,	has	found
a	way	to	get	Hermes	back	to	Mars.	The	course	he

came	up	with	would	give	Hermes	a	Mars	flyby	on	Sol	549.”

Silence.

“You	shittin'	us?”	Annie	demanded.

“Sol	549?	How's	that	even	possible?”	Asked	Bruce.	“Even	Iris	wouldn't	have
landed	til	Sol	588.”

“Iris	was	a	point-thrust	craft,”	Venkat	said.	“Hermes	has	a	constant-thrust	ion
engine.	It's	always	accelerating.	Also,	Hermes	has	a	lot	of	velocity	right	now.	On
their	current	Earth-intercept	course,	they	have	to	decelerate	for	the	next	month
just	to	slow	down	to	Earth's

speed.”

Mitch	rubbed	the	back	of	his	head.	“Wow...	549.	That's	35	sols	before	Watney
runs	out	of	food.	That	would	solve	everything.”

Teddy	leaned	forward.	“Run	us	through	it,	Venkat.	What	would	it	entail?”

“Wel,”	Venkat	began,	“If	they	did	this	'Rich	Purnel	Maneuver,'	they'd	start
accelerating	right	away,	to	preserve	their	velocity	and	gain	even	more.	They
wouldn't	intercept	Earth	at	al,	but	would	come	close	enough	to	use	a	gravity
assist	to	adjust	course.	Around	that	time,

they'd	pick	up	a	re-supply	probe	with	provisions	for	the	extended	trip.

“After	that,	they'd	be	on	an	accelerating	orbit	toward	Mars,	arriving	on	Sol	549.
Like	I	said,	it's	a	Mary	flyby.	This	isn't	anything	like	a	normal	Ares	mission.
They'l	be	going	too	fast	to	fal	in	to	orbit.	The	rest	of	the	maneuver	takes	them
back	to	Earth.	They'd	be	home	211

days	after	the	flyby.”

“What	good	is	a	flyby?”	Bruce	asked.	“They	don't	have	any	way	to	get	Watney
off	the	surface.”

“Yeah...”	Venkat	said.	“Now	for	the	unpleasant	part:	Watney	would	have	to	get
to	the	Ares-4	MAV.”

“Schiapareli	Crater!?”	Mitch	gaped.	“That's	3,200km	away!”

“3,235km	to	be	exact,”	Venkat	said.	“It's	not	out	of	the	question.	He	drove	to

Pathfinder's	landing	site	and	back.	That's	over

1,500km.”

“That	was	over	flat,	desert	terrain,”	Bruce	chimed	in.	“But	the	trip	to
Schiapareli-”

“Suffice	it	to	say,”	Venkat	interrupted,	“It	would	be	very	difficult	and	dangerous.
But	we	have	a	lot	of	clever	scientists	to	help	him	trick	out	the	rover.	Also	there
would	be	MAV	modifications.”

“What's	wrong	with	the	MAV?”	Mitch	asked.

“It's	designed	to	get	to	low	Mars	orbit,”	Venkat	explained.	“But	Hermes	would
be	on	a	flyby,	so	the	MAV	would	have	to	escape	Mars

gravity	entirely	to	intercept.”

“How?”	Mitch	asked.

“It'd	have	to	lose	weight...	a	lot	of	weight.	I	can	get	rooms	ful	of	people	working
on	these	problems	if	we	decide	to	do	this.”

“Earlier,”	Teddy	said,	“You	mentioned	a	supply	probe	for	Hermes.	We	have	that
capability?”

“Yes,	with	the	Taiyang	Shen,”	Venkat	said.	“We'd	shoot	for	a	near-Earth
rendezvous.	It's	a	lot	easier	than	getting	a	probe	to	Mars,	that's	for	sure.”

“I	see,”	Teddy	said.	“So	we	have	two	options	on	the	table:	Send	Watney	enough
food	to	last	until	Ares	4,	or	send	Hermes	back	to	get

him	right	now.	Both	plans	require	the	Taiyang	Shen,	so	we	can	only	do	one.”

“Yes,”	Venkat	said.	“We'l	have	to	pick	one.”

They	al	took	a	moment	to	consider.

“What	about	the	Hermes	crew?”	Annie	asked,	breaking	the	silence.	“Would	they
have	a	problem	with	adding...”	She	did	some	quick

math	in	her	head	“533	days	to	their	mission?”

“They	wouldn't	hesitate,”	Mitch	said.	“Not	for	a	second.	That's	why	Venkat
caled	this	meeting.”	He	cast	a	disapproving	glare	at

Venkat.	“He	wants	us	to	decide	instead.”

“That's	right,”	Venkat	said.

“It	should	be	Commander	Lewis'	cal,”	Mitch	said	sternly.

“Pointless	to	even	ask	her,”	Venkat	said.	“We	need	to	make	this	decision;	it's	a
matter	of	life	and	death.”

“She's	the	Mission	Commander,”	Mitch	said.	“Life	and	death	decisions	are	her
damn	job.”

“Easy,	Mitch,”	Teddy	said.

“Bulshit,”	Mitch	said.	“You	guys	have	done	end-runs	around	the	crew	every	time
something	goes	wrong.	You	didn't	tel	them	Watney

was	stil	alive,	now	you're	not	teling	them	there's	a	rescue	option.”

“We	already	have	a	rescue	option,”	Teddy	said.	“We're	just	discussing	another
one.”

“The	crash-lander?”	Mitch	said.	“Does	anyone	think	that'l	work?	Anyone?”

“Al	right,	Mitch,”	Teddy	said.	“You've	expressed	your	opinion,	and	we've	heard
it.	Let's	move	on.”	He	turned	to	Venkat.	“Can

Hermes	function	for	533	days	beyond	the	scheduled	mission	end?”

“It	should,”	Venkat	said.	“The	crew	may	have	to	fix	things	here	and	there,	but
they're	wel	trained.	Remember,	Hermes	was	made	to	do

al	5	Ares	missions.	It's	only	halfway	through	its	designed	lifespan.”

“It's	the	most	expensive	thing	ever	built,”	Teddy	said.	“We	can't	make	another
one.	If	something	went	wrong,	the	crew	would	die,	and

the	Ares	Program	with	them.”

“Losing	the	crew	would	be	a	disaster,”	Venkat	said.	“But	we	wouldn't	lose
Hermes.	We	can	remotely	operate	it.	So	long	as	the	reactor

and	ion	engines	continued	to	work,	we	could	bring	it	back.”

“Space	travel	is	dangerous,”	Mitch	said.	“We	can't	make	this	a	discussion	about
what's	safest.”

“I	disagree,”	Teddy	said.	“This	is	absolutely	a	discussion	about	what's	safest.
And	about	how	many	lives	are	at	stake.	Both	plans	are	risky,	but	resupplying
Watney	only	risks	one	life	while	the	Rich	Purnel	Maneuver	risks	six.”

“Consider	degree	of	risk,	Teddy,”	Venkat	said.	“Mitch	is	right.	The	crash-lander
is	high-risk.	It	could	miss	Mars,	it	could	re-enter	wrong	and	burn	up,	it	could
crash	too	hard	and	destroy	the	food...	we	estimate	30%	chance	of	success.”

“A	near-Earth	rendezvous	with	Hermes	is	more	doable?”	Teddy	asked.

“Much	more	doable,”	Venkat	confirmed.	“With	sub-second	transmission	delays,
we	can	control	the	probe	directly	from	Earth	rather

than	rely	on	automated	systems.	When	the	time	comes	to	dock,	Major	Martinez
can	pilot	it	remotely	from	Hermes	with	no	transmission

delay	at	al.	And	Hermes	has	a	human	crew,	able	to	overcome	any	hiccups	that
may	happen.	And	we	don't	have	to	do	a	reentry;	the

supplies	don't	have	to	survive	a	300m/s	impact.”

“So,”	Bruce	offered,	“We	can	have	a	high	chance	of	kiling	one	person,	or	a	low
chance	of	kiling	6	people.	Jeez.	How	do	we	even

make	this	decision?”

“We	talk	about	it,	then	Teddy	makes	the	decision,”	Venkat	said.	“Not	sure	what
else	we	can	do.”

“We	could	let	Lewis-”	Mitch	began.

“Yeah,	other	than	that,”	Venkat	interrupted.

“Question,”	Annie	said.	“What	am	I	even	here	for?	This	seems	like	something
for	you	nerds	to	discuss.”

“You	need	to	be	in	the	loop,”	Venkat	said.	“We're	not	deciding	right	now.	We'l
need	to	quietly	research	the	details	internaly.

Something	might	leak,	and	you	need	to	be	ready	to	dance	around	questions.”

“How	long	have	we	got	to	make	a	decision?”	Teddy	asked.

“The	window	for	starting	the	maneuver	ends	in	39	hours.”

“Al	right,”	Teddy	said.	“Everyone,	we	discuss	this	only	in	person	or	on	the
phone;	never	email.	And	don't	talk	to	anyone	about	this,	other	than	the	people
here.	The	last	thing	we	need	is	public	opinion	pressing	for	a	risky	cowboy	rescue
that	may	be	impossible.”

Beck:

Hey,	man.	How	ya	been?

Now	that	I'm	in	a	“dire	situation,”	I	don't	have	to	follow	social	rules	anymore.

I	can	be	honest	with	everyone.

Bearing	that	in	mind,	I	have	to	say...	dude...	you	need	to	tell	Johanssen	how	you

feel.	If	you	don’t,	you’ll	regret	it	forever.

I	won't	lie:	It	could	end	badly.	I	have	no	idea	what	she	thinks	of	you.	Or	of

anything.	She's	weird.

But	wait	till	the	mission’s	over.	You're	on	a	ship	with	her	for	another	two

months.	Also,	if	you	guys	got	up	to	anything	while	the	mission	was	in	progress,

Lewis	would	kill	you.

Venkat,	Mitch,	Annie,	Bruce,	and	Teddy	met	secretly	for	the	second	time	in	as
many	days.	“Project	Elrond”	had	taken	on	a	dark

connotation,	veiled	in	secrecy.	Many	people	knew	the	name,	none	knew	its
purpose.

Speculation	ran	rampant.	Some	thought	it	was	a	completely	new	program	in	the
works.	Others	worried	it	might	be	a	move	to	cancel

Ares	4	and	5.	Most	thought	it	was	Ares	6	in	the	works.

“It	wasn't	an	easy	decision,”	Teddy	said	to	the	assembled	elite.	“But	I've	decided
to	go	with	Iris	2.	No	Rich	Purnel	Maneuver.”

Mitch	slammed	his	fist	on	the	table.

“We'l	do	al	we	can	to	make	it	work,”	Bruce	said.

“If	it's	not	too	much	to	ask,”	Venkat	began.	“What	made	up	your	mind?”

Teddy	sighed.	“It's	a	matter	of	risk,”	he	said.	“Iris	2	only	risks	one	life.	Rich
Purnel	risks	al	six	of	them.	I	know	Rich	Purnel	is	more	likely	to	work,	but	I	don't
think	it's	six	times	more	likely.”

“You	fucking	coward,”	Mitch	said.

“Mitch...”	Venkat	said.

“You	god	damned	fucking	coward,”	Mitch	continued,	ignoring	Venkat.	“You	just
want	to	cut	your	losses.	You're	on	damage	control.

You	don't	give	a	shit	about	Watney's	life.”

“Of	course	I	do,”	Teddy	replied.	“And	I'm	sick	of	your	infantile	attitude.	You	can
throw	al	the	tantrums	you	want,	but	the	rest	of	us

have	to	be	adults.	This	isn't	a	TV	show;	the	riskier	solution	isn't	always	the	best.”

“Space	is	dangerous,”	Mitch	snapped.	“It's	what	we	do	here.	If	you	want	to	play
it	safe	al	the	time,	go	join	an	insurance	company.	And

by	the	way,	it's	not	even	your	life	you're	risking.	The	crew	can	make	up	their
own	minds	about	it.”

“No	they	can't,”	Teddy	fired	back.	“They're	too	emotionaly	involved.	Clearly,	so
are	you.	I'm	not	gambling	five	lives	to	save	one.

Especialy	when	we	might	save	him	without	risking	them	at	al.”

“Bulshit!”	Mitch	shot	back	as	he	stood	from	his	chair.	“You're	just	convincing
yourself	the	crash-lander	wil	work	so	you	don't	have	to	take	a	risk.	You're
hanging	him	out	to	dry,	you	chicken-shit	son	of	a	bitch!”

He	stormed	out	of	the	room,	slamming	the	door	behind	him.

After	a	few	seconds,	Venkat	folowed	behind,	saying	“I'l	make	sure	he	cools	off.”

Bruce	slumped	in	his	chair.	“Sheesh,”	he	said,	nervously.	“We're	scientists,	for
Christ's	sake.	What	the	hel!?”

Annie	quietly	gathered	her	things	and	placed	them	in	her	briefcase.

Teddy	looked	to	her.	“Sorry	about	that,	Annie,”	he	said.	“What	can	I	say?
Sometimes	men	let	testosterone	take	over-”

“I	was	hoping	he'd	kick	your	ass,”	she	interrupted.

“What?”

“I	know	you	care	about	the	astronauts,	but	he's	right.	You	are	a	fucking	coward.
If	you	had	bals	we	might	be	able	to	save	Watney.”

Lewis:

Hi,	Commander.

Between	training	and	our	trip	to	Mars,	I	spent	2	years	working	with	you.	I	think

I	know	you	pretty	well.	So	I’m	guessing	you	blame	yourself	for	my	situation.

Don’t.

You	were	faced	with	an	impossible	scenario	and	made	a	tough	decision.	That’s
what

Commanders	do.	And	your	decision	was	right.	If	you’d	waited	any	longer,	the
MAV

would	have	tipped.

I’m	sure	you’ve	run	through	all	the	possible	outcomes	in	your	head,	so	you
know

there’s	nothing	you	could	have	done	differently	(other	than	“be	psychic”).

You	probably	think	losing	a	crewman	is	the	worst	thing	that	can	happen.	Not

true.	Losing	the	whole	crew	is	worse.	You	kept	that	from	happening.

But	there's	something	more	important	we	need	to	discuss:	What	is	it	with	you
and

Disco?	I	can	understand	the	'70's	TV	because	everyone	loves	hairy	people	with
huge

collars.	But	Disco?

Disco!?

Vogel	checked	the	position	and	orientation	of	Hermes	against	the	projected	path.
It	matched,	as	usual.	In	addition	to	being	the

mission's	chemist,	he	was	also	an	accomplished	astrophysicist.	Though	his	duties
as	navigator	were	laughably	easy.

The	computer	knew	the	course.	It	knew	when	to	angle	the	ship	so	the	ion
engines	would	be	aimed	correctly.	And	it	knew	the	location

of	the	ship	at	al	times	(easily	calculated	from	the	position	of	the	sun	and	Earth,
and	knowing	the	exact	time	from	an	on-board	atomic

clock.)

Barring	a	complete	computer	failure	or	other	critical	event,	Vogel’s	vast
knowledge	of	astrodynamics	would	never	come	in	to	play.

Completing	the	check,	he	ran	a	diagnostic	on	the	engines.	They	were	functioning
at	peak.	He	did	al	this	from	his	quarters.	Al	on-board

computers	could	control	al	ship's	functions.	Gone	were	the	days	of	physicaly
visiting	the	engines	to	check	up	on	them.

Having	completed	his	work	for	the	day,	he	finaly	had	time	to	read	email.

Sorting	through	the	messages	NASA	deemed	worthy	to	upload,	he	read	the	most
interesting	first	and	responded	when	necessary.	His

responses	were	cached	and	would	be	sent	to	Earth	with	Johanssen's	next	uplink.

A	message	from	his	wife	caught	his	attention.	Titled	Unsere	kinder	(“our
children”),	it	contained	nothing	but	an	image	attachment.	He	raised	an	eyebrow.
Several	things	stood	out	at	once.	Firstly,	“kinder”	should	have	been	capitalized.
Helena,	a	grammar	school	teacher	in	Bremen,	was	very	unlikely	to	make	that
mistake.	Also,	to	each	other,	they	affectionately	caled	their	kids	Die	Affen.

Attempting	to	open	the	image,	his	viewer	reported	the	file	was	unreadable.

He	walked	down	the	narrow	halway.	The	crew	quarters	stood	against	the	outer
hul	of	the	constantly-spinning	ship	to	maximize

simulated	gravity.	Johanssen's	door	was	open,	as	usual.

“Johanssen.	Good	evening,”	Vogel	said.	The	crew	kept	the	same	sleep	schedule,
and	it	was	nearing	bedtime.

“Oh,	helo,”	Johanssen	said,	looking	up	from	her	computer.

“I	have	the	computer	problem,”	Vogel	explained.	“I	wonder	if	you	wil	help.”

“Sure,”	she	said.

“You	are	in	the	personal	time,”	Vogel	said.	“Perhaps	tomorrow	when	you	are	on
the	duty	is	better?”

“Now's	fine,”	she	said.	“What's	wrong?”

“It	is	a	file.	It	is	an	image,	but	my	computer	can	not	view.”

“Where's	the	file?”	she	asked,	typing	on	her	keyboard.

“It	is	on	my	shared	space.	The	name	is	'kinder.jpg'.”

“Let's	take	a	look,”	she	said.

Her	fingers	flew	over	her	keyboard	as	windows	opened	and	closed	on	her	screen.
“Definitely	a	bad	jpg	header,”	she	said.	“Probably

mangled	in	the	download.	Lemme	look	with	a	hex	editor,	see	if	we	got	anything
at	al...”

After	a	few	moments	she	said.	“This	isn't	a	jpg.	It's	a	plain	ASCII	text	file.
Looks	like...	wel	I	don't	know	what	it	is.	Looks	like	a	bunch	of	math	formulae.”
She	gestured	to	the	screen.	“Does	any	of	this	make	sense	to	you?”

Vogel	leaned	in,	looking	at	the	text.	“Ja,”	he	said.	“It	is	a	course	maneuver	for
Hermes.	It	says	the	name	is	'Rich	Purnel	Maneuver'.”

“What's	that?”	Johanssen	asked.

“I	have	not	heard	of	this	maneuver.”	He	looked	at	the	tables.	“It	is	complicated...
very	complicated...”

He	froze.	“Sol	549!?”	he	exclaimed.	“Mein	Gott!”

The	Hermes	crew	enjoyed	their	scant	personal	time	in	an	area	caled	“The	Rec”.
Consisting	of	a	table	and	barely	room	to	seat	six,	it

ranked	low	in	gravity	priority.	It's	position	amidships	granted	it	a	mere	0.2g.

Stil,	it	was	enough	to	keep	everyone	in	their	seats	as	they	pondered	what	Vogel
told	them.

“...and	then	mission	would	conclude	with	Earth	intercept	211	days	later,”	he
finished	up.

“Thank	you,	Vogel,”	Lewis	said.	She'd	heard	the	explanation	earlier	when	Vogel
came	to	her,	but	Johanssen,	Martinez,	and	Beck	were

hearing	it	for	the	first	time.	She	gave	them	a	moment	to	digest.

“Would	this	realy	work?”	Martinez	asked.

“Ja,”	Vogel	nodded.	“I	ran	the	numbers.	They	al	check	out.	It	is	briliant	course.
Amazing.”

“How	would	he	get	off	Mars?”	Martinez	asked.

Lewis	leaned	forward.	“There	was	more	in	the	message,”	she	began.	“The
maneuver	is	part	of	an	overal	idea	NASA	had	to	rescue

Watney.	We'd	have	to	pick	up	a	supply	near	Earth,	and	he'd	have	to	get	to	Ares-
4's	MAV.”

“Why	al	the	cloak	and	dagger?”	Beck	asked.

“According	to	the	message,”	Lewis	explained.	“NASA	rejected	the	idea.	They'd
rather	take	a	big	risk	on	Watney	than	a	smal	risk	on

al	of	us.	Whoever	snuck	it	in	to	Vogel's	email	obviously	disagreed.”

“So,”	Martinez	said,	“We're	talking	about	going	directly	against	NASA's
decision?”

“Yes,”	Lewis	confirmed,	“That's	what	we're	talking	about.	If	we	do	the
maneuver,	they'l	have	to	send	the	supply	ship	or	we'l	die.	We

have	the	opportunity	to	force	their	hand.”

“Are	we	going	to	do	it?”	Johanssen	asked.

They	al	looked	to	Lewis.

“I	won't	lie,”	she	said.	“I'd	sure	as	hel	like	to.	But	this	isn't	a	normal	decision.
This	is	something	NASA	expressly	rejected.	We're

talking	about	mutiny.	And	that's	not	a	word	I	throw	around	lightly.”

She	stood	and	paced	slowly	around	the	table.	“We'l	only	do	it	if	we	al	agree.	And
before	you	answer,	consider	the	consequences.	If

we	mess	up	the	supply	rendezvous,	we	die.	If	we	mess	up	the	Earth	gravity
assist,	we	die.

“If	we	do	everything	perfectly,	we	add	533	days	to	our	mission.	533	days	of
unplanned	space	travel	where	anything	could	go	wrong.

Maintenance	wil	be	a	hassle.	Something	might	break	that	we	can't	fix.	If	it's	life-
critical,	we	die.”

“Sign	me	up!”	Martinez	smiled.

“Easy,	cowboy,”	Lewis	said.	“You	and	I	are	military.	There's	a	good	chance	we'd
be	court-martialed	when	we	got	home.	As	for	the

rest	of	you,	I	guarantee	they'l	never	send	you	up	again.”

Martinez	leaned	against	the	wal,	arms	folded	with	a	half	grin	on	his	face.	The
rest	silently	considered	what	their	commander	had	said.

“If	we	do	this,”	Vogel	said.	“It	would	be	over	1000	days	of	space.	This	is	enough
space	for	a	life.	I	do	not	need	to	return.”

“Sounds	like	Vogel's	in,”	Martinez	grinned.	“Me,	too,	obviously.”

“Let's	do	it,”	Beck	said.

“If	you	think	it'l	work,”	Johanssen	said	to	Lewis,	“I	trust	you.”

“Ok,”	Lewis	said.	“If	we	go	for	it,	what's	involved?”

Vogel	shrugged.	“I	plot	the	course	and	execute	it,”	he	said.	“What	else?”

“Remote	Override,”	Johanssen	said.	“It's	designed	to	get	the	ship	back	if	we	al
die	or	something.	They	can	take	over	Hermes	from

Mission	Control.”

“But	we're	right	here,”	Lewis	said.	“We	can	undo	whatever	they	try,	right?”

“Not	realy,”	Johanssen	said.	“Remote	Override	takes	priority	over	any	on-board
controls.	Its	assumes	there's	been	a	disaster	and	the

ship's	control	panels	can't	be	trusted.”

“Can	you	disable	it?”	Lewis	asked.

“Hmm...”	Johanssen	pondered.	“Hermes	has	four	redundant	flight	computers,
each	connected	to	three	redundant	comm	systems.	If	any

computer	gets	signal	from	any	comm	system,	Mission	Control	can	take	over.	We
can't	shut	down	the	comms;	we'd	lose	telemetry	and

guidance.	We	can't	shut	down	the	computers;	we	need	them	to	control	the	ship.
I'l	have	to	disable	the	Remote	Override	on	each	system...

It's	part	of	the	OS,	I'l	have	to	jump	over	the	code...	yes.	I	can	do	it.”

“You're	sure?”	Lewis	asked.	“You	can	turn	it	off?”

“Shouldn't	be	hard,”	Johanssen	said.	“It's	an	emergency	feature,	not	a	security
program.	It	isn't	protected	against	malicious	code.”

“Malicious	code?”	Beck	smiled.	“So...	you'l	be	a	hacker?”

“Yeah,”	Johanssen	smiled	back.	“I	guess	I	wil.”

“Al	right,”	Lewis	said.	“Looks	like	we	can	do	it.	But	I	don't	want	peer	pressure
forcing	anyone	into	it.	We'l	wait	for	24	hours.	During

that	time,	anyone	can	change	their	mind.	Just	talk	to	me	in	private	or	send	me	an
email.	I'l	cal	it	off	and	never	tel	anyone	who	it	was.”

Lewis	stayed	behind	as	the	rest	filed	out.	Watching	them	leave,	she	saw	they
were	smiling.	Al	four	of	them.	For	the	first	time	since

leaving	Mars,	they	were	back	to	their	old	selves.	She	knew	right	then	no	one
would	change	their	mind.

They	were	going	back	to	Mars.

Everyone	knew	Brendan	Hutch	would	be	running	missions	soon.

He	rose	through	the	ranks	as	fast	as	one	could	in	the	large,	inertia-bound
organization.	Known	as	a	diligent	worker,	his	skil	and

leadership	qualities	were	plain	to	al	his	subordinates.

Brendan	was	in	charge	of	Mission	Control	from	1am	to	9am	every	night.
Continued	excelent	performance	in	this	role	would	certainly

net	him	a	promotion.	It	was	already	announced	he'd	be	back-up	Flight	Controler
for	Ares-4,	and	he	had	a	good	shot	at	the	top	job	for

Ares-5.

“Flight,	CAPCOM,”	came	a	voice	through	his	headset.

“Go	CAPCOM,”	Brendan	responded.	Though	they	were	in	the	same	room,	radio
protocol	was	observed	at	al	times.

“Unscheduled	status	update	from	Hermes.”

With	Hermes	90	light-seconds	away,	back-and-forth	voice	communication	was
impractical.	Other	than	media	relations,	Hermes	would

communicate	via	text	until	they	were	much	closer.

“Roger,”	Brendan	said.	“Read	it	out.”

“I...	I	don't	get	it,	Flight,”	came	the	confused	reply.	“No	real	status,	just	a	single
sentence.”

“What's	it	say?”

“Message	reads:	'Houston,	be	advised:	Rich	Purnel	is	a	steely-eyed	missile
man.'”

“What?”	Brendan	asked.	“Who	the	hel	is	Rich	Purnel?”

“Flight,	Telemetry,”	came	another	voice.

“Go	Telemetry,”	Brendan	said.

“Hermes	is	off-course.”

“CAPCOM,	advise	Hermes	they're	drifting.	Telemetry,	get	a	correction	vector
ready-”

“Negative,	Flight,”	Telemetry	interrupted.	“It's	not	drift.	They	adjusted	course.
Instrumentation	uplink	shows	a	deliberate	27.812

degree	rotation.”

“What	the	hel?”	Brendan	stammered.	“CAPCOM,	ask	them	what	the	hel.”

“Roger	Flight...	message	sent.	Minimum	reply	time	3	minutes,	4	seconds.”

“Telemetry,	any	chance	this	is	instrumentation	failure?”

“Negative,	Flight.	We're	tracking	them	with	SatCon.	Observed	position	is
consistent	with	the	course	change.”

“CAPCOM,	Read	your	logs	and	see	what	the	previous	shift	did.	See	if	a	massive
course	change	was	ordered	and	somehow	nobody

told	us.”

“Roger,	Flight.”

“Guidance,	Flight.”	Brendan	said.

“Go	Flight,”	came	the	reply	from	the	Guidance	Controler.

“Work	out	how	long	they	can	stay	on	this	course	before	it's	irreversible.	At	what
point	wil	they	no	longer	be	able	to	intercept	Earth?”

“Working	on	that	now,	Flight.”

“And	somebody	find	out	who	the	hel	Rich	Purnel	is!”

Mitch	sat	comfortably	in	Teddy's	office.

“Why'd	you	do	it,	Mitch?”	Teddy	demanded.

“Do	what?”	Mitch	asked.

“You	know	damn	wel	what	I'm	talking	about.”

“Oh,	you	mean	the	Hermes	mutiny?”	Mitch	said	innocently.	“You	know,	that'd
make	a	good	movie	title.	'The	Hermes	Mutiny.'	Got	a

nice	ring	to	it.”

“We	know	you	did	it,”	Teddy	said	sternly.	“We	don't	know	how,	but	we	know
you	sent	them	the	maneuver.”

“I	suppose	you	have	proof,	then?”

Teddy	glared.	“No.	Not	yet,	but	we're	working	on	it.”

“Realy?”	Mitch	said.	“Is	that	really	the	best	use	of	our	time?	I	mean,	we	have	a
near-Earth	resupply	to	plan,	not	to	mention	figuring	out	how	to	get	Watney	to
Schiapareli.	We've	got	a	lot	on	our	plates.”

“You're	damn	right	we	have	a	lot	on	our	plates!”	Teddy	fumed.	“After	your	little
stunt,	we're	committed	to	this	thing.”

“Alleged	stunt,”	Mitch	said.	“I	suppose	Annie	wil	tel	the	media	we	decided	to	try
this	risky	maneuver?	And	she'l	leave	out	the	mutiny	part?”

“Of	course,”	Teddy	said.	“Otherwise	we'd	look	like	idiots.”

“Guess	that's	me	off	the	hook	then!”	Mitch	smiled.	“Can't	fire	me	for	enacting
NASA	policy.	Allegedly	enacting	it,	that	is.	I	guess	Lewis	is	off	the	hook,	too.
And	maybe	Watney	gets	to	live.	Happy	endings	al	around!”

“You	may	have	kiled	the	whole	crew,”	Teddy	countered.	“Ever	think	of	that?”

“Whomever	gave	them	the	maneuver,”	Mitch	said,	“only	passed	along
information.	Lewis	made	the	decision	to	act	on	it.	If	she	let

emotion	cloud	her	judgment,	she'd	be	a	shitty	commander.	And	she's	not	a	shitty
commander.”

“If	I	can	ever	prove	it	was	you,	I'l	find	a	way	to	fire	you	for	it.”	Teddy	warned.

“Sure,”	Mitch	shrugged.	“But	if	I	wasn't	wiling	to	take	risks	to	save	lives,	I'd...”
He	thought	for	a	moment.	“Wel,	I	guess	I'd	be	you.”

Chapter	17

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	192

Holy	shit!

They're	coming	back	for	me!

I	don't	even	know	how	to	react.	I'm	choked	up!

And	I've	got	a	shitload	of	work	to	do	before	I	catch	that	bus	home.

They	can't	orbit.	If	I'm	not	in	space	when	they	pass	by,	al	they	can	do	is	wave.

I	have	to	get	to	Ares-4's	MAV.	Even	NASA	accepts	that.	And	when	the	nannies
at	NASA	recommend	a	3200km	overland	drive,	you

know	you're	trouble.

Schiapareli	Crater	here	I	come!

Wel...	not	right	away.	I	stil	have	to	do	the	aforementioned	shitload	of	work.

My	trip	to	Pathfinder	was	a	quick	jaunt	compared	to	the	epic	journey	that's
coming	up.	I	got	away	with	a	lot	of	shortcuts	because	I

only	had	to	survive	18	sols.	This	time,	things	are	different.

I	averaged	80km/sol	on	my	way	to	Pathfinder.	If	I	do	that	wel	toward	Schiapareli
it'l	take	40	sols.	Cal	it	50	to	be	safe.

But	there's	more	to	it	than	just	travel.	Once	I	get	there,	I'l	need	to	set	up	camp
and	do	a	bunch	of	MAV	modifications.	NASA

estimates	they'l	take	30	sols,	45	to	be	safe.	Between	the	trip	and	the	MAV	mods,
that's	95	sols.	Cal	it	100	because	“95”	cries	out	to	be	approximated.

So	I'l	need	to	survive	away	from	the	Hab	for	100	sols.

“What	about	the	MAV?”	I	hear	you	ask	(in	my	fevered	imagination).	“Won't	it
have	some	supplies?	Air	and	water	at	the	very	least?”

Nope.	It's	got	dick-al.

It	does	have	air	tanks,	but	they're	empty.	An	Ares	mission	needs	lots	of	O2,	N2
and	water	anyway.	Why	send	more	with	the	MAV?

Easier	to	have	the	crew	top	off	the	MAV	from	the	Hab.	Fortunately	for	my
crewmates,	the	mission	plan	had	Martinez	fil	the	MAV	tanks

on	Sol	1.

The	flyby	is	on	Sol	549,	so	I'l	need	to	leave	by	449.	That	gives	me	257	sols	to
get	my	shit	in	gear.

Seems	like	a	long	time,	doesn't	it?

In	that	time,	I	need	to	modify	the	rover	to	carry	the	Atmospheric	Regulator,
Oxygenator,	and	Water	Reclaimer.	I	cal	them	“The	Big

Three”.	Al	three	need	to	be	in	the	pressurized	area,	but	the	rover	isn't	big
enough.	Al	three	need	to	be	running	at	al	times,	but	the	rover's	batteries	can't
handle	that	load	for	long.

The	rover	wil	also	need	to	carry	al	my	food,	water,	solar	cels,	extra	battery,	my
tools,	some	spare	parts,	and	Pathfinder.	As	my	sole

means	of	communication	with	NASA,	Pathfinder	gets	to	ride	on	the	roof,
Granny	Clampett	style.

I	have	a	lot	of	problems	to	solve,	but	I	have	a	lot	of	smart	people	to	solve	them.
Pretty	much	the	whole	planet	Earth.

NASA	is	stil	working	on	the	details,	but	the	idea	is	to	use	both	rovers.	One	to
drive	around,	the	other	to	act	as	a	trailer	for	al	the	shit	I	have	to	bring.

I'l	have	to	make	structural	changes	to	that	trailer.	And	by	“structural	changes”	I
mean	“cut	a	big	hole	in	the	hul.”	Then	I	can	move	the	Big	Three	in	and	use	Hab
canvas	to	loosely	cover	the	hole.	It'l	baloon	out	when	I	pressurize	the	rover,	but

it'l	hold.

How	wil	I	cut	a	big	chunk	out	of	a	rover's	hul?	I'l	let	my	lovely	assistant	Venkat
Kapoor	explain	further:

[14:38]JPL:	I'm	sure	you're	wondering	how	to	cut	a	hole	in	the	rover.

Our	experiments	show	a	rock	sample	drill	can	get	through	the	hull.	Wear	and
tear

on	the	bit	is	minimal	(rocks	are	harder	than	carbon	composite).	You	can	cut
holes

in	a	line,	then	chisel	out	the	remaining	chunks	between	them.

I	hope	you	like	drilling.	The	drill	bit	is	1cm	wide,	the	holes	will	be	0.5cm

apart,	and	the	length	of	the	total	cut	is	11.4m.	That's	760	holes.	And	each	one

takes	160	seconds	to	drill.

Problem:	The	drills	weren't	designed	for	construction	projects.	They	were

intended	for	quick	rock	samples.	The	batteries	only	last	240	seconds.	You	do
have

two	drills,	but	you'd	still	only	get	3	holes	done	before	needing	to	recharge.	And

recharging	takes	41	minutes.

That's	173	hours	of	work,	limited	to	8	EVA	hours	per	day.	That's	21	days	of

drilling,	and	that's	just	too	long.	All	our	other	ideas	hinge	on	this	cut	working.

If	it	doesn't,	we	need	time	to	come	up	with	new	ones.

So	we	want	you	to	wire	a	drill	directly	to	Hab	power.

The	drill	expects	28.8V	and	pulls	9	Amps.	The	only	lines	that	can	handle	that	are

the	rover	recharge	lines.	They're	36V,	10A	max.	Since	you	have	two,	we're

comfortable	with	you	modifying	one.

We'll	send	you	instructions	on	how	to	step	down	the	voltage	and	put	a	new
breaker

in	the	line,	but	I'm	sure	you	already	know	how.

I'l	be	playing	with	high	voltage	power	tomorrow.	Can't	imagine	anything	going
wrong	with	that!

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	193

I	managed	to	not	kil	myself	today,	even	though	I	was	working	with	high	voltage.
Wel,	it's	not	as	exciting	as	al	that.	I	disconnected	the	line	before	I	fucked	with	it.

As	instructed,	I	turned	a	rover	charging	cable	into	a	dril	power	source.	Getting
the	voltage	was	a	simple	matter	of	adding	resistors,

which	my	electronics	kit	has	in	abundance.

I	had	to	make	my	own	a	9	Amp	breaker.	I	strung	three	3A	breakers	in	paralel.
There's	no	way	for	9A	to	get	through	that	without

tripping	al	three	in	rapid	succession.

Then	I	had	to	rewire	a	dril.	Pretty	much	the	same	thing	I	did	with	Pathfinder.
Take	out	the	battery	and	replace	it	with	a	power	line	from	the	Hab.	But	this	time
it	was	a	lot	easier.

Pathfinder	was	too	big	to	fit	through	any	of	my	airlocks,	so	I	had	to	do	al	the
rewiring	outside.	Ever	done	electronics	while	wearing	a

space	suit?	Pain	in	the	ass.	I	even	had	to	make	a	workbench	out	of	MAV	landing
struts,	remember?

Anyway,	the	dril	fit	in	the	airlock	easily.	It's	only	a	meter	tal,	and	shaped	like	a
jackhammer.	We	did	our	rock	sampling	standing	up,

like	Apolo	astronauts.

Also,	unlike	my	Pathfinder	hatchet-job,	I	had	the	ful	schematics	of	the	dril.	I

removed	the	battery	and	attached	a	power	line	where	it

used	to	be.	Then,	taking	the	dril	and	it's	new	cord	outside,	I	connected	it	to	the
modified	rover	charger	and	fired	it	up.

Worked	like	a	charm!	The	dril	whirled	away	with	happy	abandon.	Somehow,	I
had	managed	to	do	everything	right	the	first	try.	Deep

down,	I	thought	I'd	fry	the	dril	for	sure.

It	wasn't	even	midday	yet.	I	figured	why	not	get	a	jump	on	driling?

[10:07]	Watney:	Power	line	modifications	complete.	Hooked	it	up	to	a	drill,	and

it	works	great.	Plenty	of	daylight	left.	Send	me	a	description	of	that	hole	you

want	me	to	cut.

[10:25]	JPL:	Glad	to	hear	it.	Starting	on	the	cut	sounds	great.	Just	to	be	clear,

these	are	modifications	to	Rover	1,	which	we've	been	calling	“the	trailer.”	Rover
2

(the	one	with	your	modifications	for	the	trip	to	Pathfinder)	should	remain	as-is

for	now.

You'll	be	taking	a	chunk	out	of	the	roof,	just	in	front	of	the	airlock	in	the

rear	of	the	vehicle.	The	hole	needs	to	be	at	least	2.5m	long	and	the	full	2m	width

of	the	pressure	vessel.

Before	any	cuts,	draw	the	shape	on	the	trailer,	and	position	the	trailer	where

Pathfinder's	camera	can	see	it.	We'll	let	you	know	if	you	got	it	right.

[10:43]	Watney:	Roger.	Take	a	pic	at	11:30	if	you	haven't	heard	from	me	by
then.

The	rovers	are	made	to	interlock	so	one	can	tow	the	other.	That	way	you	can

rescue	your	crewmates	if	the	shit	hits	the	fan.	For	that

same	reason,	rovers	can	share	air	via	hoses	you	connect	between	them.	That
little	feature	wil	let	me	share	atmosphere	with	the	trailer	on	my	long	drive.

I'd	stolen	the	trailer's	battery	long	ago;	it	had	no	ability	to	move	under	it's	own
power.	So	I	hitched	it	up	to	my	awesomely	modified

rover	and	towed	it	in	to	place	near	Pathfinder.

Venkat	told	me	to	“draw”	the	shape	I	plan	to	cut,	but	he	neglected	to	mention
how.	It's	not	like	I	have	a	Sharpie	that	can	work	out	on

the	surface.	So	I	vandalized	Martinez's	bed.

The	cots	are	basicaly	hammocks.	Lightweight	string	woven	loosely	into
something	that's	comfortable	to	sleep	on.	Every	gram	counts

when	making	stuff	to	send	to	Mars.

I	unraveled	Martinez's	bed	and	took	the	string	outside.	I	taped	it	to	the	trailer	hul
along	the	path	I	planned	to	cut.	Yes,	of	course	duct	tape	works	in	a	near-vacuum.
Duct	tape	works	anywhere.	Duct	tape	is	magic	and	should	be	worshiped.

I	can	see	what	NASA	has	in	mind.	The	rear	of	the	trailer	has	an	airlock	that	we're
not	going	to	mess	with.	The	cut	is	just	ahead	of	it,

and	wil	leave	plenty	of	space	for	The	Big	Three	to	stand.

I	have	no	idea	how	NASA	plans	to	power	the	Big	Three	for	24½	hours	a	day	and
stil	have	energy	left	to	drive.	I	bet	they	don't	know,

either.	But	they're	smart;	they'l	work	something	out.

[11:49]	JPL:	What	we	can	see	of	your	planned	cut	looks	good.	We're	assuming
the

other	side	is	identical.	You're	cleared	to	start	drilling.

[12:07]	Watney:	That's	what	she	said.

[12:25]	JPL:	Seriously,	Mark?	Seriously?

First,	I	depressurized	the	trailer.	Cal	me	crazy,	but	I	didn't	want	the	dril
explosively	launched	at	my	face.

Then	I	had	to	pick	somewhere	to	start.	I	thought	it'd	be	easiest	to	start	on	the
side.	I	was	wrong.

The	roof	would	have	been	better.	The	side	was	a	hassle	because	I	had	to	hold	the
dril	paralel	to	the	ground.	This	isn't	your	dad's

Black	&	Decker	we're	talking	about.	It's	a	meter	long	and	only	safe	to	hold	by
the	handles.

Getting	it	to	bite	was	nasty.	I	pressed	it	against	the	hul	and	turned	it	on,	but	it
wandered	al	over	the	place.	So	I	got	my	trusty	hammer	and	screwdriver.	With	a
few	taps,	I	made	a	smal	chip	in	the	carbon	composite.

That	gave	the	bit	a	place	to	seat,	so	I	could	keep	driling	in	one	place.	As	NASA
predicted,	it	took	about	two	minutes	to	get	al	the	way

through.

I	folowed	the	same	procedure	for	the	second	hole	and	it	went	much	smoother.
After	the	third	hole,	the	dril's	overheat	light	came	on.

It	wasn't	designed	to	operate	constantly	for	so	long.	Fortunately,	it	sensed	the
overheat	and	warned	me.	So	I	leaned	it	against	the

workbench	for	a	few	minutes	and	it	cooled	down.	One	thing	you	can	say	about
Mars:	It's	really	cold.	The	thin	atmosphere	doesn't	conduct	heat	very	wel,	but	it
cools	everything	eventualy.

I	had	already	removed	the	dril's	cowling	(the	power	cord	needed	a	way	in).	A
pleasant	side	effect	is	the	dril	cools	even	faster.	Though

I'l	have	to	clean	it	thoroughly	every	few	hours	as	dust	accumulates.

By	17:00,	when	the	sun	began	to	set,	I	had	driled	75	holes.	A	good	start,	but
there's	stil	tons	to	do.	Eventualy	(probably	tomorrow)

I'l	have	to	start	driling	holes	that	I	can't	reach	from	the	ground.	For	that	I'l	need
something	to	stand	on.

I	can't	use	my	“workbench.”	It's	got	Pathfinder	on	it,	and	the	last	thing	I'm	going
to	do	is	mess	with	that.	But	I've	got	three	more	MAV

landing	struts.	I'm	sure	I	can	make	a	ramp	or	something.

Anyway,	that's	al	stuff	for	tomorrow.	Tonight	is	about	eating	a	full	ration	for
dinner.

Awww	yeah.	That's	right.	I'm	either	getting	rescued	on	Sol	549	or	I'm	dying.
That	means	I	have	35	days	of	extra	food.	I	can	indulge

once	in	a	while.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	194

I	average	a	hole	every	3.5	minutes.	That	includes	the	occasional	breather	to	let
the	dril	cool	off.

I	learned	this	by	spending	al	damn	day	driling.	After	8	hours	of	dul,	physicaly
intense	work,	I	had	137	holes	to	show	for	it.

It	turned	out	to	be	easy	to	deal	with	places	I	couldn't	reach.	I	didn't	need	to
modify	a	landing	strut	after	al.	I	just	had	to	get	something	to	stand	on.	I	used	a
geological	sample	container	(also	known	as	“a	box”).

Before	I	was	in	contact	with	NASA,	I	would	have	worked	more	than	8	hours.	I
can	stay	out	for	10	before	even	dipping	in	to

“emergency”	air.	But	NASA's	got	a	lot	of	Nervous	Nelies	who	don't	want	me	out
longer	than	spec.

With	today's	work,	I'm	about	¼	of	the	way	through	the	whole	cut.	At	least,	¼	of
the	way	through	the	driling.	Then	I'l	have	759	little

chunks	to	chisel	out.	And	I'm	not	sure	how	wel	carbon	composite	is	going	to
take	to	that.	But	NASA'l	do	it	a	thousand	times	back	on

Earth	and	tel	me	the	best	way	to	get	it	done.

Anyway,	at	this	rate,	it'l	take	4	more	days	of	(boring-ass)	work	to	finish	the
driling.

I've	actualy	exhausted	Lewis's	supply	of	shitty	'70's	TV.	And	I've	read	al	of
Johanssen's	mystery	books.

I	rifled	through	other	crewmates'	stuff	to	find	entertainment.	But	al	of	Vogel's
stuff	is	in	German,	Beck	brought	nothing	but	medical

journals,	and	Martinez	didn't	bring	anything.

I'm	got	realy	bored,	so	I	decided	to	pick	a	theme	song!

Something	appropriate.	And	naturaly,	it	should	be	something	from	Lewis's
godawful	'70's	colection.	It	wouldn't	be	right	any	other

way.

Another	day,	another	bunch	of	holes.	145	this	time	(I'm	getting	better.)	I'm	half-

Dick.

Anyway,	I'm	stil	bored	at	night.	I	guess	that's	a	good	thing.	Nothing's	wrong	with
the	Hab,	there's	a	plan	to	save	me,	and	the	physical

labor	is	making	me	sleep	wonderfuly.

I	miss	tending	the	potatoes.	The	Hab	isn't	the	same	without	them.

There's	stil	soil	everywhere.	No	point	in	lugging	it	back	outside.	Lacking
anything	better	to	do,	I	ran	some	tests	on	it.	Amazingly,	some	of	the	bacteria
survived.	The	population	is	strong	and	growing.	That's	pretty	impressive,	when
you	consider	it	was	exposed	to	near-vacuum	and	sub-arctic	temperatures	for	over
24	hours.

My	guess	is	pockets	of	ice	formed	around	some	of	the	bacteria,	leaving	a	bubble
of	survivable	pressure	inside,	and	the	cold	wasn't

quite	enough	to	kil	them.	With	hundreds	of	milions	of	bacteria,	it	only	takes	one
survivor	to	stave	off	extinction.

Life	is	amazingly	tenacious.	They	don't	want	to	die	anymore	than	I	do.

I	fucked	up.

I	fucked	up	big	time.	I	made	a	mistake	that	might	kil	me.

I	started	my	EVA	around	08:45,	same	as	always.	I	got	my	hammer	and
screwdriver	and	started	chipping	the	trailer's	hul.	It's	a	pain	in

the	ass	to	make	a	chip	before	each	driling,	so	I	make	al	the	day's	chips	in	a	single
go.

After	chipping	out	150	divots	(hey,	I'm	an	optimist),	I	got	to	work.

It	was	the	same	as	yesterday	and	the	day	before.	Dril	through,	relocate.	Dril
through,	relocate.	Dril	through	a	third	time,	then	set	the	dril	aside	to	cool.	Repeat
that	process	over	and	over	til	lunchtime.

At	12:00,	I	took	a	break.	Back	in	the	Hab,	I	enjoyed	a	nice	lunch	and	played
some	chess	against	the	computer	(it	kicked	my	ass).

Then	back	out	for	the	day's	second	EVA.

At	13:30	my	ruination	occurred,	though	I	didn't	realize	it	at	the	time.

The	worst	moments	in	life	are	heralded	by	smal	observations.	The	tiny	lump	on
your	side	that	wasn't	there	before.	Coming	home	to

your	wife	and	seeing	two	wine	glasses	in	the	sink.	Any	time	you	hear	“We
interrupt	this	program...”

For	me,	it	was	when	the	dril	didn't	start.

Only	three	minutes	earlier,	it	was	working	fine.	I	had	finished	a	hole	and	set	the
dril	aside	to	cool.	Same	as	always.

But	when	I	tried	to	get	back	to	work,	it	didn't	work.	The	power	light	wouldn't
even	come	on.

I	wasn't	worried.	If	al	else	failed,	I	had	another	dril.	It	would	take	a	few	hours	to
wire	it	up,	but	that's	hardly	a	concern.

The	power	light	being	off	meant	there	was	probably	something	wrong	with	the
line.	A	quick	glance	at	the	airlock	window	showed	the

lights	were	on	in	the	Hab.	So	there	were	no	systemic	power	problems.	I	checked
my	new	breakers	and	sure	enough,	al	three	had	tripped.

I	guess	the	dril	puled	a	little	too	much	amperage.	No	big	deal.	I	reset	the
breakers	and	got	back	to	work.	The	dril	fired	right	up,	and	I	was	back	to	making
holes.

Doesn't	seem	like	a	big	deal,	right?	I	certainly	didn't	think	so	at	the	time.

I	finished	my	day	at	17:00	after	driling	131	holes.	Not	as	good	as	yesterday,	but	I
lost	some	time	to	the	dril	malfunction.

I	reported	my	progress.

[17:08]	Watney:	131	holes	today.	488	total.	Minor	drill	issue;	it	tripped	the

breakers.	There	may	be	an	intermittent	short	in	the	drill,	probably	in	the

attachment	point	of	the	power	line.	Might	need	to	redo	it.

Earth	an	Mars	are	just	over	18	light-minutes	apart	now.	Usualy,	NASA
responded	within	25	minutes.	But	this	time,	no	reply	came.

Remember,	I	do	al	my	communication	from	Rover	2,	which	relays	everything
through	Pathfinder.	I	can't	just	lounge	in	the	Hab	awaiting	a

reply;	I	have	to	stay	in	the	rover	until	they	acknowledge	the	message.

[17:38]	Watney:	Have	received	no	reply.	Last	message	sent	30	minutes	ago.
Please

acknowledge.

I	waited	another	30	minutes.	Stil	no	reply.	Fear	started	to	take	root.

Back	when	JPL's	Nerd	Brigade	hacked	the	rover	and	Pathfinder	to	be	an	poor-
man's	IM	client,	they	sent	me	a	cheat	sheet	for

troubleshooting.	I	executed	the	first	instruction:

[18:09]	Watney:	system_command:	STATUS

[18:09]	SYSTEM:	Last	message	sent	00h31m	ago.	Last	message	received
26h17m	ago.

Last	ping	reply	from	probe	received	04h24m	ago.	WARNING:	52	unanswered
pings.

Pathfinder	was	no	longer	talking	to	the	rover.	It	had	stopped	answering	pings	4
hours	and	24	minutes	ago.	Some	quick	math	told	me

that	was	around	13:30	today.

The	same	time	the	dril	died.

I	tried	not	to	panic.	The	troubleshooting	sheet	has	a	list	of	things	to	try	if
communication	is	lost.	They	are	(in	order):

1.	Confirm	power	stil	flowing	to	Pathfinder.

2.	Reboot	rover.

3.	Reboot	Pathfinder	by	disconnecting/reconnecting	power.

4.	Instal	rover's	comm	software	on	the	other	rover's	computer,	try	from	there.

5.	If	both	rovers	fail,	problem	is	likely	with	Pathfinder.	Check	connections	very
closely.	Clean	Pathfinder	of	Martian	dust.

6.	Spel	message	in	Morse	Code	with	rocks,	include	things	attempted.	Problem
may	be	recoverable	with	remote	update	of	Pathfinder.

I	only	got	as	far	as	step	1.	I	checked	Pathfinder's	connections	and	the	negative
lead	was	no	longer	attached.

I	was	elated!	What	a	relief!	With	a	smile	on	my	face,	I	fetched	my	electronics	kit
and	prepared	to	reattach	the	lead.	I	puled	it	out	of	the	probe	to	give	it	a	good
cleaning	(as	best	I	can	with	the	gloves	of	my	space	suit)	and	noticed	something
strange.	The	insulation	had	melted.

I	pondered	this	development.	Melted	insulation	usualy	means	a	short.	More
current	than	the	wire	could	handle	had	passed	through.	But

the	bare	portion	of	the	wire	wasn't	black	or	even	singed,	and	the	positive	lead's
insulation	wasn't	melted	at	al.

Then,	one	by	one,	the	horrible	realities	of	Mars	came	in	to	play.	The	wire
wouldn't	be	burnt	or	singed.	That's	a	result	of	oxidization.

And	there's	no	oxygen	in	the	air.	There	likely	was	a	short	after	al.	But	with	the
positive	lead	being	unaffected,	the	power	must	have	come	from	somewhere
else...

And	the	dril's	breaker	tripped	around	the	same	time...

Oh...	shit...

The	internal	electronics	for	Pathfinder	included	a	ground	lead	to	the	hul.	This
way	it	could	not	build	up	a	static	charge	in	Martian

weather	conditions	(no	water	and	frequent	sandblasting	can	make	impressive
static	charge).

The	hul	sat	on	Panel	A,	one	of	four	sides	of	the	tetrahedron	which	brought
Pathfinder	the	Mars.	The	other	3	sides	are	stil	in	Ares	Valis	where	I	left	them.

Between	Panel	A	and	the	workbench	were	the	Mylar	baloons	Pathfinder	had
used	to	tumble-land.	I	had	shredded	many	of	them	to

transport	it.	Stil,	a	lot	of	material	remained;	enough	to	reach	around	Panel	A	and
be	in	contact	with	the	hul.	I	should	mention	that	Mylar	is	conductive.

At	13:30,	I	leaned	the	dril	against	the	workbench.	The	dril's	cowling	was	off	to
make	room	for	the	power	line.	The	workbench	is

metal.	If	the	dril	leaned	against	the	workbench	just	right,	it	could	make	a	metal-
to-metal	connection.

And	that's	exactly	what	happened.

Power	traveled	from	the	dril	line's	positive,	through	the	workbench,	through	the
Mylar,	through	Pathfinder's	hul,	through	a	bunch	of

extremely	sensitive	and	irreplaceable	electronics,	and	out	the	negative	lead	of
Pathfinder's	power	line.

Pathfinder	operates	on	50	miliamps.	It	got	nine	thousand	miliamps,	which
plowed	through	the	delicate	electronics,	frying	everything	along	the	way.	The
breakers	tripped,	but	it	was	too	late.

Pathfinder's	dead.	I've	lost	the	ability	to	contact	Earth.

I'm	on	my	own.

Sigh...

Just	once	I'd	like	something	to	go	to	plan,	ya	know?

Mars	keeps	trying	to	kil	me.

Wel...	Mars	didn't	electrocute	Pathfinder.	So	I'l	amend	that:

Mars	and	my	stupidity	keep	trying	to	kil	me.

Ok,	enough	self-pity.	I'm	not	doomed.	Things	wil	be	just	be	harder	than	planned.
I	have	al	I	need	to	survive.	And	Hermes	is	stil	on	the

way.

I	speled	out	a	Morse	Code	message	using	rocks.	“PATHFINDER	FRIED	WITH
9AMPS.	DEAD	FOREVER.	PLAN

UNCHANGED.	WILL	GET	TO	MAV.”

If	I	can	get	to	the	Ares-4	MAV,	I'l	be	set.	But	having	lost	contact	with	NASA,	I
have	to	design	my	own	Great	Martian	Winnebago.

For	the	time	being,	I've	stopped	al	work	on	it.	I	don't	want	to	continue	without	a
plan.	I'm	sure	NASA	had	al	kinds	of	ideas,	but	now	I

have	to	come	up	with	one	on	my	own.

As	I	mentioned,	the	Big	Three	(Atmospheric	Regulator,	Oxygenator,	and	Water
Reclaimer)	are	critical	components.	I	worked	around

them	for	my	trip	to	Pathfinder.	I	used	CO2	filters	to	regulate	the	atmosphere,	and
brought	enough	oxygen	and	water	for	the	whole	trip.	That	won't	work	this	time.	I
need	the	Big	Three.

Problem	is,	they	soak	up	a	lot	of	power,	and	have	to	run	al	day	long.	The	rover
batteries	have	18kwh	of	juice.	The	Oxygenator	alone

uses	44.1kwh	per	sol.	See	my	problem?

You	know	what?	“Kilowatt-hours	per	sol”	is	a	pain	in	the	ass	to	say.	I'm	gonna
invent	a	new	scientific	unit	name.	One	kilowatt-hour

per	sol	is...	it	can	be	anything...	um...	I	suck	at	this...	oh	fuck	it.	I'l	cal	it	a	“pirate-
ninja.”

Al	told,	the	Big	Three	need	69.2pn,	most	of	that	going	to	the	Oxygenator	and
Atmospheric	Regulator.	(The	Water	Reclaimer	only

needs	3.6	of	that.)

There'l	be	cutbacks.

The	easiest	one	is	the	Water	Reclaimer.	I	have	620L	of	water	(I	had	a	lot	more
before	the	Hab	blew	up).	I	only	need	three	liters	of

water	per	sol,	so	my	supply	wil	last	206	sols.	There's	only	100	sols	after	I	leave
and	before	I'm	picked	up	(or	die	in	the	attempt).

Conclusion:	I	don't	need	the	Water	Reclaimer	at	al.	I'l	drink	as	needed,	and	dump
my	waste	outdoors.	Yeah,	that's	right	Mars,	I'm

gonna	piss	and	shit	on	you.	That's	what	you	get	for	trying	to	kil	me	al	the	time.

There.	I	saved	myself	3.6	pirate-ninjas.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	198

I've	had	a	breakthrough	with	the	Oxygenator!

I	spent	most	of	the	day	looking	at	the	specs.	It	heats	CO2	to	900C,	then	passes	it
over	a	zirconia	electrolysis	cel	to	yank	the	carbon

atoms	off.	Heating	the	gas	is	what	takes	most	of	the	energy.	Why	is	that
important?	Because	I'm	just	one	guy	and	the	Oxygenator	was

made	for	six.	1/6th	the	quantity	of	CO2	means	1/6th	the	energy	to	heat	it.

The	spec	said	44.1pn,	but	al	this	time	it's	only	been	using	7.35	because	of	the
reduced	load.	Now	we're	getting	somewhere!

Then	there's	the	matter	of	the	Atmospheric	Regulator.	The	regulator	samples	the
air,	figures	out	what's	wrong	with	it,	and	corrects	the

problem.	Too	much	CO2?	Take	it	out.	Not	enough	O2?	Add	some.	Without	it,
the	Oxygenator	is	worthless.	The	CO2	needs	to	be

separated	in	order	to	be	processed.

The	regulator	analyzes	the	air	with	spectroscopy,	then	separates	the	gasses	by
supercooling	them.	Different	elements	turn	to	liquid	at

different	temperatures.	On	Earth,	supercooling	this	much	air	would	take
ridiculous	amounts	of	energy.	But	(as	I'm	acutely	aware)	this	isn't	Earth.

Supercooling	is	done	by	pumping	air	to	a	component	outside	the	Hab.	The	air
quickly	cools	to	the	outdoor	temperature,	which	ranges

from	-150C	to	0C.	When	it's	warm,	additional	refrigeration	is	used,	but	cold	days
can	turn	air	to	liquid	for	free.	The	real	energy	cost	comes	from	heating	it	back
up.	If	it	came	back	to	the	Hab	unheated,	I'd	freeze	to	death.

“But	wait!”	You're	thinking,	“Mars's	atmosphere	isn't	liquid.	Why	does	the	Hab's
air	condense?”

The	Hab's	atmosphere	is	90	times	as	dense,	so	it	turns	to	liquid	at	much	higher
temperatures.	The	regulator	gets	the	best	of	both

worlds.	Literaly.	Side	note:	Mars's	atmosphere	does	condense	at	the	poles.	In
fact,	it	solidifies	into	dry	ice.

Problem:	the	regulator	takes	21.5pn.	Even	adding	some	of	the	Hab's	power	cels
would	barely	power	the	regulator	for	a	sol,	let	alone

have	juice	to	drive.

More	thinking	is	required.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	199

I've	got	it.	I	know	how	to	power	the	Oxygenator	and	Atmospheric	Regulator.

The	problem	with	smal	pressure	vessels	is	CO2	toxicity.	You	can	have	al	the
oxygen	in	the	world,	but	once	the	CO2	gets	above	1%

you'l	start	to	get	drowsy.	At	2%	it's	like	being	drunk.	At	5%,	it's	hard	to	stay
conscious.	8%	wil	eventualy	kil	you.	Keeping	alive	isn't	about	oxygen,	it's	about
getting	rid	of	CO2.

I	need	the	regulator.	But	I	don't	need	the	Oxygenator	al	the	time.	I	just	need	to
get	CO2	out	of	the	air,	and	back-fil	with	oxygen.	I

have	50	liters	of	liquid	oxygen	in	two	25L	tanks	here	in	the	Hab.	That's	50,000L
in	gaseous	form,	enough	to	last	85	days.	Not	enough	to

see	me	through	to	rescue,	but	a	hel	of	a	lot.

The	regulator	can	separate	the	CO2	and	store	it	in	a	tank,	adding	oxygen	to	my
air	as	needed.	When	I	run	low	on	oxygen,	I	can	camp

out	for	a	day	and	use	all	my	power	to	run	the	Oxygenator.	That	way,	the
Oxygenator's	power	consumption	doesn't	eat	up	my	driving	juice.

So	I'l	run	the	regulator	al	the	time,	but	only	run	the	Oxygenator	on	days	I
dedicate	to	using	it.

After	the	regulator	freezes	the	CO2	out,	the	oxygen	and	nitrogen	are	stil	gasses,
but	they're	-75C.	If	the	regulator	fed	that	back	to	my	air	without	reheating	it,	I'd
be	a	Popsicle	within	hours.	Most	of	the	regulator's	power	goes	to	heating	the
return	air	so	that	doesn't	happen.

But	I	have	a	better	way	to	heat	it	up.	Something	NASA	wouldn't	consider	on
their	most	homicidal	day.

The	RTG!

Yes,	the	RTG.	You	may	remember	it	from	my	exciting	trip	to	Pathfinder.	A
lovely	lump	of	Plutonium	so	radioactive	it	gives	off	1500

watts	of	heat	which	it	uses	to	harvest	100W	of	electricity.	So	what	happens	to	the
other	1400W?	It	gets	radiated	out	as	heat.

On	the	trip	to	Pathfinder,	I	had	to	actualy	remove	insulation	from	the	rover	to
vent	excess	heat	from	the	damn	thing.

I	ran	the	numbers.	The	regulator	uses	790W	to	constantly	reheat	air.	The	RTG's
1400W	is	more	than	equal	to	the	task,	as	wel	as

keeping	the	rover	a	reasonable	temperature.

To	test,	I	shut	down	the	heaters	in	the	regulator	and	noted	its	power
consumption.	After	a	few	minutes	I	turned	them	right	back	on

again.	Jesus	Christ	that	return	air	was	cold.	But	I	got	the	data	I	wanted.

With	heating,	the	regulator	needs	21.5pn.	Without	it...	(drum	rol)	1pn.	That's
right,	almost	all	of	the	power	was	going	to	heat.

As	with	most	of	life's	problems,	this	one	can	be	solved	by	a	box	of	pure
radiation.

I	spent	the	rest	of	the	day	double-checking	my	numbers	and	running	more	tests.
It	al	checks	out.	I	can	do	this.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	200

I	hauled	rocks	today.

I	needed	to	know	what	kind	of	power	efficiency	the	rover/trailer	wil	get.	On	the
way	to	Pathfinder,	I	got	80km	from	18kwh.	This	time,

the	load	wil	be	a	lot	heavier.	I'l	be	towing	the	trailer	and	al	the	other	shit.

I	backed	the	rover	up	to	the	trailer	and	attached	the	tow	clamps.	Easy	enough.

The	trailer	has	been	depressurized	for	some	time	now	(there's	a	couple	of
hundred	little	holes	in	it,	after	al),	so	I	opened	both	airlock	doors	to	have	a

straight	shot	at	the	interior.	Then	I	threw	a	bunch	of	rocks	in.

I	had	to	guess	at	the	weight.	The	heaviest	thing	I'l	bring	with	me	is	the	water.
620kg	worth.	My	freeze-dried	potatoes	wil	add	another

200kg.	I'l	probably	have	more	solar	cels	than	before,	and	maybe	a	battery	from
the	Hab.	Plus	the	Atmospheric	Regulator	and

Oxygenator,	of	course.	Rather	than	weigh	al	that	shit,	I	took	a	guess	and	caled	it
1200kg.

Half	a	cubic	meter	of	basalt	weighs	about	that	much	(more	or	less).	After	two
hours	of	brutal	labor,	during	which	I	whined	a	lot,	I	got	it	al	loaded	in.

Then,	with	both	batteries	fuly	charged,	I	drove	circles	around	the	Hab	until	I
drained	them	both.

With	a	blistering	top	speed	of	25kph,	it's	not	an	action-packed	thril	ride.	But	I
was	impressed	it	could	maintain	that	speed	with	al	the	extra	weight.	The	rover
has	spectacular	torque.

But	physical	law	is	a	pushy	little	shit,	and	it	exacted	revenge	for	the	additional
weight.	I	only	got	57km	before	I	was	out	of	juice.

That	was	57km	on	level	ground,	without	having	to	power	the	regulator	(which
won't	take	much	with	the	heater	off).	Cal	it	50km	per

day	to	be	safe.	At	that	rate	it	would	take	65	days	to	get	to	Schiapareli.	But	that's
just	the	travel	time.

Every	now	and	then,	I'l	need	to	break	for	a	day	and	let	the	Oxygenator	use	al	the
power.	How	often?	After	a	bunch	of	math	I	worked

out	that	my	18pn	budget	can	power	the	Oxygenator	enough	to	make	2.5	sols	of
O2.	I'd	have	to	stop	every	two	to	three	sols	to	reclaim

oxygen.	My	65	sol	trip	would	become	91!

That's	too	fucking	long.	I'l	tear	my	own	head	off	if	I	have	to	live	in	the	rover	that
long.	Anyway,	I'm	exhausted	from	lifting	rocks	and	whining	about	lifting	rocks.

I	think	I	puled	something	in	my	back.	Gonna	take	it	easy	the	rest	of	today.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	201

Yeah,	I	definitely	puled	something	in	my	back.	I	woke	up	in	agony.

So	I	took	a	break	from	rover	planning.	Instead,	I	spent	the	day	taking	drugs	and
playing	with	radiation.

First,	I	loaded	up	on	Vicodin	for	my	back.	Hooray	for	Beck's	medical	supplies!

Then	I	drove	out	to	the	RTG.	It	was	right	where	I	left	it,	in	a	hole	4km	away.
Only	an	idiot	would	keep	that	thing	near	the	Hab.	So

anyway,	I	brought	it	back	to	the	Hab.

Either	it'l	kil	me	or	it	won't.	A	lot	of	work	went	in	to	making	sure	it	doesn't
break.	If	I	can't	trust	NASA,	who	can	I	trust?	(For	now	I'l	forget	that	NASA	told
us	to	bury	it	far	away.)

I	stored	it	on	the	roof	of	the	rover	for	the	trip	back.	That	puppy	realy	spews	heat.

I	have	some	flexible	plastic	tubing	intended	for	minor	Water	Reclaimer	repairs.
After	bringing	the	RTG	in	to	the	Hab,	I	very	carefully	glued	some	tubing	around
the	heat	baffles.	Using	a	funnel	made	from	a	piece	of	paper,	I	ran	water	through
the	tubing,	letting	it	drain	in	to	a	sample	container.

Sure	enough,	the	water	heated	up.	That's	not	realy	a	surprise,	but	it's	nice	to	see
thermodynamics	being	wel-behaved.

The	Atmospheric	Regulator	doesn't	run	constantly.	The	freeze-separation	speed
is	driven	by	the	weather	outside.	So	the	returning	frigid

air	doesn't	come	as	a	steady	flow.	And	the	RTG	generates	a	constant,	predictable
heat.	It	can't	“ramp	up”	its	output.

So	I'l	heat	water	with	the	RTG	to	create	a	heat	reservoir,	then	I'l	make	the	return
air	bubble	through	it.	That	way	I	don't	have	to	worry	about	when	the	air	comes
in.	And	I	won't	have	to	deal	with	sudden	temperature	changes	in	the	rover.

When	the	Vicodin	wore	off,	my	back	hurt	even	more	than	before.	I'm	going	to
need	to	take	it	easy.	I	can't	just	pop	pils	forever.	So	I'm

taking	a	few	days	off	from	heavy	labor.	To	that	end,	I	made	a	little	invention	just
for	me...

I	took	Johanssen's	cot	and	cut	out	the	hammock.	Then	I	draped	spare	Hab	canvas
over	the	frame,	making	a	pit	inside	the	cot,	with

extra	canvass	around	the	edges.	Weighing	down	the	excess	canvass	with	rocks,	I
now	had	a	water-tight	bathtub!

It	only	took	100L	to	fil	the	shalow	tub.

Then,	I	stole	the	pump	from	the	Water	Reclaimer.	(I	can	go	quite	a	while	without
the	Water	Reclaimer	operating).	Hooking	it	up	to	my

RTG-water-heater,	I	put	both	the	input	and	output	lines	in	the	tub.

Yes,	I	know	this	is	ridiculous,	but	I	hadn't	had	a	bath	since	Earth,	and	my	back
hurts.	Besides,	I'm	going	to	spend	100	sols	with	the

RTG	anyway.	A	few	more	won't	hurt.	That's	my	bulshit	rationalization	and	I'm
sticking	with	it.

It	took	two	hours	to	heat	the	water	to	37C.	Once	it	did,	I	shut	off	the	pump,	and
got	in.	Oh	man,	al	I	can	say	is	“Ahhhhhh.”

Why	the	hell	didn't	I	think	of	this	before?

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	207

I	spent	the	last	week	recovering	from	back	problems.	The	pain	wasn't	bad,	but
there	aren't	any	chiropractors	on	Mars,	so	I	wasn't

taking	chances.

I	took	hot	baths	twice	a	day,	laid	in	my	bunk	a	lot,	and	watched	shitty	'70's	TV.
I've	already	seen	Lewis's	entire	colection,	but	I	didn't	have	much	else	to	do.	I
was	reduced	to	watching	reruns.

I	got	a	lot	of	thinking	done.

I	can	make	everything	better	by	having	more	solar	panels.	The	14	panels	I	took
to	Pathfinder	provided	the	18kwh	that	the	batteries

could	store.	When	traveling,	I	stowed	the	panels	on	the	roof.	The	trailer	gives	me
room	to	store	another	7	(half	of	its	roof	wil	be	missing	because	of	the	hole	I'm
cutting	in	it).

This	trip's	power	needs	wil	be	driven	by	the	Oxygenator.	It	al	comes	down	to
how	much	power	I	can	give	that	greedy	little	fucker	in	a

single	sol.	I	want	to	minimize	how	often	I	have	days	with	no	travel.	The	more
juice	I	can	give	the	Oxygenator,	the	more	oxygen	it'l	liberate,	and	the	longer	I
can	go	between	those	“air-sols.”

Let's	get	greedy.	Lets	say	I	can	find	a	home	for	14	more	panels	instead	of	7.	Not
sure	how	to	do	that,	but	let's	say	I	can.	That	would

give	me	38pn	to	work	with,	which	would	net	me	5.1	sols	of	oxygen	per	air-sol.
I'd	only	have	to	stop	once	per	five	sols.	That's	much	more	reasonable.

Plus,	if	I	can	arrange	battery	storage	for	the	extra	power,	I	could	drive	100km	per
sol!	Easier	said	than	done,	though.	That	extra

18kwh	of	storage	wil	be	tough.	I'l	have	to	take	2	of	the	Hab's	9kwh	fuel	cels	and
load	them	on	to	the	rover	or	trailer.	They	aren't	like	the	rover's	batteries;	they're
not	smal	or	portable.	They're	light	enough,	but	they're	pretty	big.	I	may	have	to
attach	them	to	the	outside	hul,	and	that	would	eat	in	to	my	solar	cel	storage.

100km	per	sol,	stopping	every	fifth	sol	to	reclaim	oxygen.	If	I	could	pul	that	off,
I'd	get	there	40	sols.	That	would	be	sweet!

In	other	news,	It	occurred	to	me	that	NASA	is	probably	shitting	bricks.	They're
watching	me	with	satelites,	and	haven't	seen	me	come

out	of	the	Hab	for	six	days.	With	my	back	better,	it	was	time	to	drop	them	a	line.

I	headed	out	for	an	EVA.	This	time,	being	very	careful	while	lugging	rocks
around,	I	speled	out	a	Morse	code	message:	“INJURED

BACK.	BETTER	NOW.	CONTINUING	ROVER	MODS.”

That	was	enough	physical	labor	for	today.	I	don't	want	to	overdo	it.

Think	I'l	have	a	bath.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	208

Today,	it	was	time	to	experiment	with	the	panels.

First,	I	put	the	Hab	on	low	power	mode:	No	internal	lights,	al	nonessential
systems	offline,	al	internal	heating	suspended.	I'd	be	outside	most	of	the	day
anyway.

I	detached	28	panels	from	the	solar	farm	and	dragged	them	to	the	rover.	I	spent
four	hours	stacking	them	this	way	and	that.	The	poor

rover	looked	like	the	Beverly	Hilbilies	truck.	Nothing	I	did	worked.

The	only	way	to	get	al	28	on	the	roof	was	to	make	stacks	so	high	they'd	fal	off
the	first	time	I	turned.	If	I	lashed	them	together,	they'd	fal	off	as	a	unit.	If	I	found
a	way	to	attach	them	perfectly	to	the	rover,	the	rover	would	tip.	I	didn't	even
bother	to	test.	It	was	obvious	by	looking	and	I	didn't	want	to	break	shit.

I	haven't	removed	the	chunk	of	hul	from	the	trailer	yet.	Half	the	holes	are	driled,
but	I'm	not	committed	to	anything.	If	I	left	it	in	place,	I	could	have	four	stacks	of
seven	cels.	That	would	work	fine;	it's	just	two	rovers	worth	of	what	I	did	for	the
trip	to	Pathfinder.

Problem	is,	I	need	that	opening.	The	regulator	has	to	be	in	the	pressurized	area
and	it's	too	big	to	fit	in	the	rover.	Plus	which,	the

Oxygenator	needs	to	be	in	a	pressurized	area	while	operating.	I'l	only	need	it
every	5	sols,	but	what	would	I	do	on	that	sol?	No,	the	hole	has	to	be	there.

As	it	is,	I'l	be	able	to	stow	21	panels.	I	need	homes	for	the	other	seven.	There's
only	one	place	they	can	go:	The	sides	of	the	rover	and	trailer.

One	of	my	earlier	modifications	was	“saddlebags”	draped	over	the	rover.	One
side	held	the	extra	battery	(stolen	from	what	is	now	the

trailer)	while	the	other	side	was	ful	of	rocks	as	counterweight.

I	won't	need	them	this	time	around.	I	can	return	the	second	battery	to	the	trailer
whence	it	came.	In	fact,	it'l	save	me	the	hassle	of	the	mid-drive	EVA	I	had	to	do
every	day	to	swap	cables.	When	the	rovers	are	linked	up,	they	share	resources
including	electricity.

I	went	ahead	and	reinstaled	the	trailer's	battery.	It	took	me	two	hours	but	it's	out
of	the	way	now.	I	removed	the	saddlebags	and	set

them	aside.	They	may	be	handy	down	the	line.	If	I've	learned	one	thing	from	my
stay	at	Club	Mars,	it's	that	everything	can	be	useful.

I	had	liberated	the	sides	of	the	rover	and	trailer.	After	staring	at	them	for	a	while,
I	had	my	solution.

I'l	make	L-brackets	that	stick	out	from	the	undercarriages,	with	the	hooks	facing
up.	Two	brackets	per	side	to	make	a	shelf.	I	could

set	panels	on	the	shelves	and	lean	them	against	the	rover.	Then	I'd	lash	them	to
the	hul	with	homemade	rope.

There'l	be	four	“shelves”	total;	two	on	the	rover	and	two	on	the	trailer.	If	the
brackets	stick	out	far	enough	to	accommodate	two

panels,	I	could	store	8	additional	panels	that	way.	That	would	give	me	one	more
panel	than	I'd	even	planned	for.

I'l	make	those	brackets	and	instal	them	tomorrow.	I	would	have	done	it	today,
but	it	got	dark	and	I	got	lazy.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	209

Cold	night	last	night.	The	solar	cels	were	stil	detached	from	the	farm,	so	I	had	to
leave	the	Hab	in	low-power	mode.	I	did	turn	the	heat	back	on	(I'm	not	insane),
but	I	set	the	internal	temperature	to	1C	to	conserve	power.	Waking	up	to	frigid
weather	was	surprisingly

nostalgic.	I	grew	up	in	Chicago,	after	al.

But	nostalgia	only	lasts	so	long.	I	vowed	to	complete	the	brackets	today,	so	I	can
return	the	panels	to	the	farm.	Then	I	can	turn	the

damn	heat	back	on.

I	headed	out	to	the	MAV's	landing	strut	array.	Most	of	the	MAV	was	made	from
composite,	but	the	struts	had	to	absorb	the	shock	of

landing.	Metal	was	the	way	to	go.

Each	strut	is	2	meters	long,	and	held	together	by	bolts.	I	brought	them	in	to	the
Hab	to	save	myself	the	hassle	of	working	in	an	EVA

suit.	I	took	each	strut	apart,	yielding	a	bunch	of	metal	strips.

Shaping	the	brackets	involved	a	hammer	and...	wel	that's	it,	actualy.	Making	an
“L”	doesn't	take	a	lot	of	precision.

I	needed	holes	where	the	bolts	would	pass	through.	Fortunately,	my	Pathfinder-
murdering	dril	made	short	work	of	that	task.

Attaching	the	brackets	to	the	undercarriages	of	the	rover	and	trailer	was	easy.
The	undercarriages	come	right	off.	I	bolted	the	brackets	in	place	and	returned	the
undercarriages	where	they	belonged.	Important	note	–	an	undercarriage	is	not
part	of	the	pressure	vessel.	The	holes	I	driled	won't	let	my	air	out.

I	tested	the	brackets	by	hitting	them	with	rocks.	This	kind	of	sophistication	is
what	we	interplanetary	scientists	are	known	for.

After	convincing	myself	the	brackets	wouldn't	break	at	the	first	sign	of	use,	I
tested	the	new	arrangement.	Two	stacks	of	seven	solar

cels	on	the	rover;	another	seven	on	the	trailer,	then	two	per	shelf.	They	al	fit.

After	lashing	the	cels	in	place,	I	took	a	little	drive.	I	did	some	basic	acceleration
and	deceleration,	turned	in	increasingly	tight	circles,	and	even	did	a	power-stop.
The	cels	didn't	budge.

28	solar	cels,	baby!	And	room	for	one	extra!

After	some	wel-earned	fist-pumping,	I	unloaded	the	cels	and	dragged	them	back
to	the	farm.	No	Chicago	morning	for	me	tomorrow.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	211

I	am	smiling	a	great	smile.	The	smile	of	a	man	who	fucked	with	his	car	and
didn't	break	it.	This	is	considerably	more	rare	than	you	might	think.

I	spent	today	removing	unnecessary	crap	from	the	rover	and	trailer.	I	was	pretty
damn	aggressive	about	it,	too.	Space	inside	the

pressure	vessels	is	premium.	The	more	crap	I	clear	out	of	the	rover,	the	more
space	there	is	for	me.	The	more	crap	I	clear	out	of	the	trailer,	the	more	supplies	I
can	store	in	it,	and	the	less	I	have	to	store	in	the	rover.

First	off:	Each	vehicle	had	a	bench	for	passengers.	Bye!

Next:	there's	no	reason	for	the	trailer	to	have	life	support.	The	oxygen	tanks,
nitrogen	tanks,	CO2	filter	assembly...	al	unnecessary.	It'l	be	sharing	air	with	the
rover	(which	has	its	own	copy	of	each	of	those)	and	it'l	be	carrying	the	regulator
and	Oxygenator.	Between	the	Hab	components	it'l	be	carrying	and	the	rover,
there'l	be	two	redundant	life	support	systems.	That's	plenty.

Then	I	yanked	the	driver's	seat	and	control	panel	out	of	the	trailer.	The	link-up
with	the	rover	is	physical.	The	trailer	doesn't	do	anything	but	get	dragged	along
and	fed	air.	It	doesn't	need	controls	or	brains.	However,	I	did	salvage	its
computer.	It's	smal	and	light,	so	I'l	bring	it	with	me.	If	something	goes	wrong
with	the	rover's	computer	en-route,	I'l	have	a	spare.

The	trailer	had	tons	more	space	now.	It	was	time	for	experimentation.

The	Hab	has	twelve	9kwh	batteries.	They're	bulky	and	awkward.	Over	two
meters	tal,	a	half-meter	wide,	and	3/4	meter	thick.

Making	them	bigger	makes	them	take	less	mass	per	kwh	of	storage.	Yeah,	it's
counter-intuitive.	But	once	NASA	figured	out	they	could

increase	volume	to	decrease	mass	they	were	al	over	it.	Mass	is	the	expensive
part	about	sending	shit	to	Mars.

I	detached	two	of	them.	The	Hab	mostly	uses	the	batteries	at	night.	As	long	as	I
return	them	before	the	end	of	the	day,	things	should	be	fine.

With	both	of	the	trailer's	airlock	doors	open	I	was	able	to	get	the	first	battery	in.
After	playing	real-life	Tetris	for	a	while	I	found	a	way	to	get	the	first	battery	out
of	the	way	enough	to	let	the	second	battery	in.	Together,	they	eat	up	the	whole
front	half	of	the	trailer.	If	I	hadn't	cleared	the	useless	shit	out	earlier	today,	I'd
never	have	gotten	them	both	in.

The	trailer's	battery	is	in	the	undercarriage,	but	the	main	power	line	runs	through
the	pressure	vessel.	I	was	able	to	wire	the	Hab

batteries	directly	in.	(No	smal	feat	in	the	damn	EVA	suit).

A	system	check	from	the	rover	showed	I	had	done	the	wiring	correctly.

This	may	al	seem	minor,	but	it's	awesome.	It	means	I	can	have	29	solar	cels	and
36kwh	of	storage.	I'l	be	able	to	do	my	100km	per

day	after	al.

4	days	out	of	5,	anyway.

According	to	my	calender,	the	Hermes	resupply	probe	is	being	launched	from
China	in	two	days	(if	there	were	no	delays).	If	that

screws	up,	the	whole	crew	wil	be	in	deep	shit.	I'm	more	nervous	about	that	than
anything	else.

I've	been	in	mortal	danger	for	months;	I'm	kind	of	used	to	it	now.	But	now	I'm
nervous	again.	Dying	would	suck,	but	my	crewmates

dying	would	be	way	worse.	And	I	won't	find	out	how	the	launch	went	til	I	get	to
Schiapareli.

Good	luck,	guys.

Chapter	19

“Hey,	Melissa...”	said	Robert.	“Am	I	getting	through?	Can	you	see	me?”

“Loud	and	clear,	babe,”	said	Commander	Lewis.	“The	video	link	is	solid.”

“They	say	I	have	5	minutes,”	Robert	said.

“Better	than	nothing,”	Lewis	said.	Floating	in	her	quarters,	she	gently	touched
the	bulkhead	to	stop	drifting.	“It's	nice	to	see	you	in	realtime	for	a	change.”

“Yeah,”	Robert	smiled.	“I	can	hardly	notice	the	delay.	I	gotta	say,	I	wish	you
were	coming	home.”

Lewis	sighed,	“Me	too,	babe.”

“Don't	get	me	wrong,”	Robert	quickly	added,	“I	understand	why	you're	doing	al
this.	Stil,	from	a	selfish	point	of	view,	I	miss	my	wife.

Hey,	are	you	floating?”

“Huh?”	Lewis	said.	“Oh,	yeah.	The	ship	isn't	spinning	right	now.	No	centripetal
gravity.”

“Why	not?”

“Because	we're	docking	with	the	Taiyang	Shen	in	a	few	days.	We	can't	spin
while	we	dock	with	things.”

“I	see,”	said	Robert.	“So	how	are	things	up	on	the	ship?	Anyone	giving	you
shit?”

“No,”	Lewis	shook	her	head.	“They're	a	good	crew;	I'm	lucky	to	have	them.”

“Oh	hey!”	Robert	said.	“I	found	a	great	addition	to	our	colection!”

“Oh?	What'd	you	get?”

“An	original	production	8-track	of	Abba's	Greatest	Hits.	Stil	in	the	original
packaging.”

Lewis	widened	her	eyes.	“Seriously?	A	1973	or	one	of	the	reprints?”

“1973	al	the	way.”

“Wow!	Good	find!”

“I	know,	right!?”

With	a	final	shudder,	the	jetliner	came	to	a	stop	at	the	gate.

“Oh	gods,”	said	Venkat,	massaging	his	neck.	“That	was	the	longest	flight	I've
ever	been	on.”

“Mm,”	said	Teddy,	rubbing	his	eyes.

“At	least	we	don't	have	to	go	to	Jiuquan	til	tomorrow,”	Venkat	moaned.	“14½
hours	of	flying	is	enough	for	one	day.”

“Don't	get	too	comfortable,”	Teddy	said.	“We	stil	have	to	go	through	customs
and	we'l	probably	have	to	fil	out	a	bunch	of	forms

because	we're	U.S.	Government	officials...	it's	gonna	be	hours	before	we	sleep.”

“Craaaap.”

Gathering	their	carry-on	luggage,	they	trudged	off	the	plane	with	the	rest	of	the
weary	travelers.

Beijing	Capital	International	Airport's	Terminal	3	echoed	with	the	cacophony
common	to	huge	air	terminals.	Venkat	and	Teddy

continued	forward	as	the	Chinese	citizens	from	their	flight	split	off	to	go	to	a
simpler	point-of-entry	process.

As	Venkat	took	his	place	in	line,	Teddy	filed	in	behind	him	and	scanned	the
terminal	for	a	convenience	store.	Any	form	of	caffeine

would	be	welcome.

“Excuse	me,	gentlemen,”	came	a	voice	from	beside	them.

They	turned	to	see	a	young	Chinese	man	wearing	casual	attire.	“My	name	is	Su
Bin	Bao,”	he	said	in	perfect	English.	“I	am	an	employee

of	the	China	National	Space	Administration.	I	wil	be	your	guide	and	translator
during	your	stay	in	the	People's	Republic	of	China.”

“Nice	to	meet	you,	Mr.	Su,”	Teddy	said.	“I'm	Teddy	Sanders,	and	this	is	Dr.
Venkat	Kapoor.”

“We	need	sleep,”	Venkat	said	immediately.	“Just	as	soon	as	we	get	through
customs,	please	take	us	to	a	hotel	to	sleep.”

“I	can	do	better	than	that,	Dr.	Kapoor,”	Su	smiled.	“You	are	official	guests	of	the
People's	Republic	of	China.	You	have	been	pre-

authorized	to	bypass	customs.	I	can	take	you	to	your	hotel	immediately.”

“I	love	you,”	Venkat	said.

“Tel	the	People's	Republic	of	China	we	said	thanks,”	Teddy	added.

“I'l	pass	that	along,”	Su	Bin	smiled.

“Helena,	my	love,	”	Vogel	said	to	his	wife.	“I	trust	you	are	well?	”

“Yes,	”	she	said.	“I'm	fine.	But	I	do	miss	you.	”

“Sorry.	”

“Can't	be	helped,	”	she	shrugged.

“How	are	our	monkeys?	”

“The	children	are	fine,	”	she	smiled.	“Eliza	is	adjusting	to	life	in	junior	high,	and
Victor	is	goalkeeper	for	his	high	school's	team.	”

“Excellent!	”	Vogel	said.	“I	hear	you	are	at	Mission	Control.	Was	NASA	unable
to	pipe	the	signal	to	Bremen?	”

“They	could	have,	”	she	said.	“But	it	was	easier	for	them	to	bring	me	to	Houston.
A	free	vacation	to	the	United	States.	Who	am	I	to	turn	that	down?	”

“Well	played.	And	how	is	my	mother?	”

“As	well	as	can	be	expected,	”	Helena	said.	“She	has	her	good	days	and	bad
days.	My	last	few	visits,	she	didn't	recognize	me.	In	a	way,	it's	a	blessing.	She
doesn't	have	to	worry	about	you	like	I	do.	”

“S	he	hasn't	worsened?	”	He	asked.

“No,	she's	about	the	same	as	when	you	left.	The	doctors	are	sure	she'll	still	be
here	when	you	return.	”

“Good,	”	he	said.	“I	was	worried	I'd	seen	her	for	the	last	time.	”

“Alex,	”	Helena	said,	“Will	you	be	safe?	”

“As	safe	as	we	can	be,	”	he	said.	“The	ship	is	in	perfect	condition,	and	after
receiving	the	Taiyang	Shen,	we	will	have	all	the	supplies	we	need	for	the
remainder	of	the	journey.	”

“Be	careful,	”	She	said.

“I	will,	my	love,	”	Vogel	promised.

“Welcome	to	Jiuquan,”	Guo	Ming	said.	“I	hope	your	flight	was	smooth?	”

Su	Bin	translated	Guo	Ming's	words	as	Teddy	took	the	second-best	seat	in	the
observation	room.

“Yes,	thank	you,”	Teddy	said.	“The	hospitality	of	your	people	has	been
wonderful.	The	private	jet	you	arranged	to	bring	us	here	was	a

nice	touch.”

“My	people	have	enjoyed	working	with	your	advance	team,”	Guo	Ming	said.
“The	last	month	has	been	very	interesting.

Attaching	an	American	probe	to	a	Chinese	booster.	I	believe	this	is	the	first	time
it's	ever	been	done.”

“It	just	goes	to	show,”	Teddy	said.	“Love	of	science	is	universal	across	al
cultures.”

Guo	Ming	nodded.	“My	people	have	especially	commented	on	the	work	ethic	of
your	man	Mitch	Henderson.	He	is	very

dedicated.”

“He's	a	pain	in	the	ass,”	Teddy	said.

Su	Bin	paused	before	translating,	but	pressed	on.

Guo	Ming	laughed.	“You	can	say	that,”	he	said.	“I	cannot.”

“So	explain	it	again,”	Beck's	sister	Amy	said.	“Why	do	you	have	to	do	an
EVA?”

“I	probably	don't,”	Beck	explained.	“I	just	need	to	be	ready	to.”

“Why?”

“In	case	the	probe	can't	dock	with	us.	If	something	goes	wrong,	it'l	be	my	job	to
go	out	and	grab	it	.	”

“Can't	you	just	move	Hermes	to	dock	with	it?”

“No	way,”	Beck	said.	“Hermes	is	huge.	It's	not	made	for	fine	maneuvering
control.”

“Why	does	it	have	to	be	you?”

“Cause	I'm	the	EVA	specialist.”

“But	I	thought	you	were	the	Doctor.”

“I	am,”	Beck	said.	“Everyone	has	multiple	roles.	I'm	the	doctor,	the	biologist,
and	the	EVA	specialist.	Commander	Lewis	is	our

geologist.	Johanssen	is	the	sysop	and	reactor	tech.	And	so	on.”

“How	about	that	good	looking	guy...	Martinez?”	Amy	asked.	“What	does	he

do?”

“He	pilots	the	MDV	and	MAV.”	Beck	said.	“He's	also	married	with	a	kid,	you
lecherous	homewrecker.”

“Ah	wel.	How	about	Watney?	What	did	he	do?”

“He's	our	botanist	and	engineer.	And	don't	talk	about	him	in	the	past	tense.”

“Engineer?	Like	Scotty?”

“Kind	of,”	Beck	said.	“He	fixes	stuff.”

“I	bet	that's	coming	in	handy	now.”

“Yeah,	no	shit.”

“They're	a	weird	bunch,	these	Chinese	nerds,”	Mitch	said.	“But	they	make	a
good	booster.”

“Good.”	Venkat	said.	“How's	the	linkage	between	the	booster	and	our	probe?”

“It	al	checks	out,”	Mitch	said.	“JPL	folowed	the	specs	perfectly.	It	fits	like	a
glove.”

“Any	concerns	or	reservations?”	Venkat	asked.

“Yeah.	I'm	concerned	about	what	I	ate	last	night.	I	think	it	had	an	eyebal	in	it.”

“I'm	sure	there	wasn't	an	eyebal.”

“The	engineers	here	made	it	for	me	special,”	Mitch	said.

“There	may	have	been	an	eyebal,”	Venkat	said.	“They	hate	you.”

“Why?”

“Cause	you're	a	dick,	Mitch,”	Venkat	said.	“A	total	dick.	To	everyone.”

“Fair	enough.	So	long	as	the	probe	gets	to	Hermes,	they	can	burn	me	in	fucking
effigy	for	al	I	care.”

“Wave	to	Daddy!”	Marissa	said,	waving	David's	hand	at	the	camera.	“Wave	to
Daddy!”

“He's	too	young	to	know	what's	going	on,”	Martinez	said.

“Just	think	of	the	playground	cred	he'l	have	later	in	life,”	she	said.	“'My	dad
went	to	Mars.	What's	your	dad	do?'”

“Yes,	I'm	pretty	awesome,”	he	agreed.

Marissa	continued	to	wave	David's	hand	at	the	camera.	David	was	more
interested	in	his	other	hand,	which	was	actively	engaged	in

picking	his	nose.

“So,”	Martinez	said.	“You're	pissed.”

“You	can	tel?”	Marissa	asked.	“I	tried	to	hide	it.”

“We've	been	together	since	we	were	15.	I	know	when	you're	pissed.”

“You	volunteered	to	extend	the	mission	533	days,”	she	said.	“Asshole.”

“Yeah,”	Martinez	said.	“I	figured	that'd	be	the	reason.”

“Your	son	wil	be	in	kindergarten	when	you	get	back.	He	won't	have	any
memories	of	you.”

“I	know,”	Martinez	said.

“I	have	to	wait	another	533	days	to	get	laid!”

“So	do	I,”	he	said	defensively.

“I	have	to	worry	about	you	that	whole	time,”	she	added.

“Yeah,”	he	said.	“Sorry.”

She	took	a	deep	breath.	“We'l	get	past	it.”

“We'l	get	past	it,”	he	agreed.

“Welcome	to	CNN's	Mark	Watney	Report.	Today	we	have	the	Director	of	Mars
Operations	Venkat	Kapoor.	He's	speaking	to	us	live

via	satelite	from	China.	Dr.	Kapoor,	thank	you	for	joining	us.”

“Happy	to	do	it,”	Venkat	said.

“So	Dr.	Kapoor,	tel	us	about	the	Taiyang	Shen.	Why	go	to	China	to	launch	a
probe?	Why	not	launch	it	from	the	US?”

“Hermes	isn't	going	to	orbit	Earth,”	Venkat	said.	“It's	just	passing	by	on	its	way
to	Mars.	And	its	velocity	is	huge.	We	need	a	booster	capable	of	not	only
escaping	Earth's	gravity,	but	matching	Hermes's	current	velocity.	Only	the
Taiyang	Shen	has	enough	power	to	do	that.”

“Tel	us	about	the	probe	itself.”

“It	was	a	rush	job,”	Venkat	said.	“JPL	only	had	30	days	to	put	it	together.	They
had	to	be	as	safe	and	efficient	as	they	could.	It's

basicaly	a	shel	ful	of	food	and	other	supplies.	It	has	a	standard	satelite	thruster
package	for	maneuvering,	but	that's	it.”

“And	that's	enough	to	fly	to	Hermes?”

“The	Taiyang	Shen	wil	send	it	to	Hermes.	The	thrusters	are	for	fine	control	and
docking.	And	JPL	didn't	have	time	to	make	a

guidance	system.	So	it'l	be	remote-controled	by	a	human	pilot.”

“Who	wil	be	controling	it?”	Cathy	asked.

“The	Ares	3	pilot,	Major	Rick	Martinez.	As	the	probe	approaches	Hermes,	he'l
take	over	and	guide	it	to	the	docking	port.”

“And	what	if	there's	a	problem?”

“Hermes	wil	have	their	EVA	specialist,	Dr.	Chris	Beck,	suited	up	and	ready	the
whole	time.	If	necessary	he	wil	literaly	grab	the	probe

with	his	hands	and	drag	it	to	the	docking	port.”

“Sounds	kind	of	unscientific,”	Cathy	laughed.

“You	want	unscientific?”	Venkat	smiled.	“If	the	probe	can't	attach	to	the	docking
port	for	some	reason,	Beck	wil	open	the	probe	and

carry	its	contents	to	the	airlock.”

“Like	bringing	in	the	groceries?”	Cathy	asked.

“Exactly	like	that,”	Venkat	said.	“And	we	estimate	it	would	take	4	trips	back	and
forth.	But	that's	al	an	edge	case.	We	don't	anticipate	any	problems	with	the
docking	process.”

“Sounds	like	you're	covering	al	your	bases,”	Cathy	smiled.

“We	have	to,”	Venkat	said.	“If	they	don't	get	those	supplies...	wel,	they	need
those	supplies.”

“Thanks	for	taking	the	time	to	answer	our	questions,”	Cathy	said.

“Always	a	pleasure,	Cathy.”

He	fidgeted	in	the	chair,	unsure	what	to	say.	After	a	moment,	he	puled	a
handkerchief	from	his	pocket	and	mopped	sweat	from	his

balding	head.

“What	if	the	probe	doesn't	get	to	you?”	He	asked.

“Try	not	to	think	about	that,”	Johanssen	said.

“Your	mother	is	so	worried	she	couldn't	even	come.”

“I'm	sorry,”	Johanssen	mumbled,	looking	down.

“She	can't	eat,	she	can't	sleep,	she	feels	sick	al	the	time.	I'm	not	much	better.
How	can	they	make	you	do	this?”

“They're	not	'making'	me	do	it,	Dad.	I	volunteered.”

“Why	would	you	do	that	to	your	mother?”	He	demanded.

“Sorry,”	Johanssen	mumbled.	“Watney's	my	crewmate.	I	can't	just	let	him	die.”

He	sighed.	“I	wish	we'd	raised	you	to	be	more	selfish.”

She	chuckled	quietly.

“How	did	I	end	up	in	this	situation?”	He	lamented.	“I'm	the	district	sales
manager	of	a	napkin	factory.	Why	is	my	daughter	in	space?”

Johanssen	shrugged.

“You	were	always	scientificaly	minded,”	he	said.	“It	was	great!	Straight-A
student.	Hanging	around	nerdy	guys	too	scared	to	try

anything.	No	wild	side	at	al.	You're	every	father's	dream	daughter.”

“Thanks,	Dad,	I-”

“But	then	you	got	on	a	giant	bomb	that	blasted	you	to	Mars.	And	I	mean	that
literaly.”

“Technicaly,”	she	corrected,	“the	booster	only	took	me	in	to	orbit.	It	was	the
nuclear	powered	ion	engine	that	took	me	to	Mars.”

“Oh,	much	better!”	He	said.

“Dad,	I'l	be	al	right.	Tel	Mom	I'l	be	al	right.”

“What	good	wil	that	do?”	He	said.	“She's	going	to	be	tied	up	in	knots	until
you're	back	home.”

“I	know,”	Johanssen	mumbled.	“But...”

“What?”	He	said.	“But	what?”

“I	won't	die.	I	realy	won't.	Even	if	everything	goes	wrong.”

“What	do	you	mean?”

Johanssen	furrowed	her	brow.	“Just	tel	Mom	I	won't	die.”

“How?	I	don't	understand.”

“I	don't	want	to	get	in	to	the	how,”	Johanssen	said.

“Look,”	he	said,	leaning	toward	the	camera.	“I've	always	respected	your	privacy
and	independence.	I	never	tried	to	pry	in	to	your	life,

never	tried	to	control	you.	I've	been	realy	good	about	that,	right?”

“Yeah,”	she	said.

“So	in	exchange	for	a	lifetime	of	staying	out	of	your	business,	let	me	nose	in	just
this	once.	What	are	you	not	teling	me?”

She	fel	silent	for	several	seconds.	Finaly,	she	said	“They	have	a	plan.”

“Who?”

“There's	always	have	a	plan,”	she	said.	“They	work	out	everything	in	advance.”

“What	plan?”

“They	picked	me	to	survive.	I'm	youngest.	I	have	the	skils	necessary	to	get	home
alive.	And	I'm	the	smalest	and	need	the	least	food.”

“What	happens	if	the	probe	fails,	Beth,”	her	father	asked.	This	time,	he	was
uncharacteristicaly	firm.

“Everyone	would	die	but	me,”	she	said.	“They'd	al	take	pils	and	die.	They'l	do	it
right	away	so	they	don't	use	up	any	food.

Commander	Lewis	picked	me	to	be	the	survivor.	She	told	me	about	it	yesterday.
I	don't	think	NASA	knows	about	it.”

“And	the	supplies	would	last	until	you	got	back	to	Earth?”

“No,”	she	said.	“We	have	enough	food	left	to	feed	six	people	for	a	month.	If	I
was	the	only	one,	it	would	last	6	months.	With	a	reduced

diet	I	could	stretch	it	to	9.	But	it'l	be	17	months	before	I	get	back.”

“So	how	would	you	survive?”

“The	supplies	wouldn't	be	the	only	source	of	food.”	she	said.

He	widened	his	eyes.	“Oh...	oh	my	god...”

“Just	tel	Mom	the	supplies	would	last,	ok?”

Taiyang	Shen's	con-trail	wafted	in	the	chily	Gobi	sky.	The	ship,	no	longer	visible
to	the	naked	eye,	pressed	onward	toward	orbit.	Its	deafening	roar	dwindled	to	a
distant	rumbling	thunder.

“Perfect	launch,”	Venkat	said	enthusiasticaly.

“Of	course,”	said	Zhu	Tao.

“You	guys	realy	came	through	for	us,”	Venkat	said.	“And	we're	grateful!”

“Naturaly.”

“And	hey,	you	guys	get	a	seat	on	Ares	5.	Everyone	wins.”

“Mmm.”

Venkat	looked	at	Zhu	Tao	sideways.	“You	don't	seem	too	happy.”

“I	spent	4	years	working	on	Taiyang	Shen,”	he	said.	“So	did	countless	other
researchers,	scientists,	and	engineers.	Everyone	poured	their	souls	in	to
construction	while	I	waged	a	constant	political	battle	to	maintain	funding.

“In	the	end,	we	built	a	beautiful	probe.	The	largest,	sturdiest	unmanned	probe	in
history.	And	now	it's	sitting	in	a	warehouse.	It'l	never	fly.	The	State	Council
won't	fund	another	booster	like	that.”

He	turned	to	Venkat.	“It	could	have	been	a	lasting	legacy	of	scientific	research.
Now	it's	a	delivery	run.	We'l	get	a	Chinese	astronaut

on	Mars,	but	what	science	wil	he	bring	back	that	some	other	astronaut	couldn't
have?	This	operation	is	a	net	loss	for	mankind's

knowledge.”

“Wel,”	Venkat	said	cautiously,	“It's	a	net	gain	for	Mark	Watney.”

“Mmm,”	Zhu	Tao	said.

“Distance	61m,	velocity	2.3m/s,”	Johanssen	said.

“No	problem,”	Martinez	said,	his	eyes	glued	to	his	screens.	One	showed	the
camera	feed	from	docking	port	A,	the	other	a	constant

feed	of	the	probe's	telemetry.

Lewis	floated	behind	Johanssen	and	Martinez's	stations.

“Visual	contact,”	Beck's	voice	came	over	the	radio.	He	stood	in	Airlock	3	(via
magnetic	boots),	fuly	suited	up	with	the	outer	door

open.	The	bulky	SAFER	Unit	on	his	back	would	alow	him	free	motion	in	space
should	the	need	arise.	An	attached	tether	led	to	a	spool	on

the	wal.

“Vogel,”	Lewis	said	in	to	her	headset.	“You	in	position?”

Vogel	stood	in	the	stil-pressurized	Airlock	2,	suited	up	save	his	helmet.	“Ja,	in
position	and	ready,”	he	replied.	He	was	the	emergency

EVA	if	Beck	needed	rescue.

“Al	right,	Martinez,”	Lewis	said.	“Bring	it	in.”

“Aye,	Commander.”

“Distance	43m,	velocity	2.3m/s.”	Johanssen	caled	out.

“Al	stats	nominal,”	Martinez	reported.

“Slight	rotation	in	the	probe,”	Johanssen	said.	“Relative	rotational	velocity	is
0.05rps.”

“Anything	under	0.3	is	fine,”	Martinez	said.	“The	capture	system	can	deal	with
it.”

“Probe	is	wel	within	manual	recovery	range,”	Beck	reported.

“Copy,”	Lewis	said.

“Distance	22m,	velocity	2.3m/s.”	Johanssen	said.	“Angle	is	good.”

“Slowing	her	down	a	little,”	Martinez	said,	sending	instructions	to	the	probe.

“Velocity	1.8...	1.3...”	Johanssen	reported.	“0.9...	stable	at	0.9m/s.”

“Range?”	Martinez	asked.

“12m,”	Johanssen	replied.	“Velocity	steady	at	0.9m/s.”

“Angle?”

“Angle	is	good.”

“Then	we're	in	line	for	auto-capture,”	Martinez	said.	“Come	to	papa.”

The	probe	drifted	gently	to	the	docking	port.	Its	capture	boom,	a	long	metal
triangle,	entered	the	port's	funnel,	scraping	slightly	along	the	edge.	The	port
puled	the	boom	in,	aligning	and	orienting	the	probe	automaticaly.	After	several
loud	clanks	echoed	through	the	ship,	the	computer	reported	success.

“Docking	complete,”	Martinez	said.

“Seal	is	tight,”	Johanssen	said.

“Beck,”	Lewis	said.	“Your	services	won't	be	needed.”

“Roger	that,	commander,”	Beck	said.	“Closing	airlock.”

“Vogel,	return	to	interior,”	she	ordered.

“Copy,	Commander,”	he	said.

“Airlock	pressure	to	100%”	Beck	reported.	“Re-entering	ship...	I'm	back	in.”

“Also	inside,”	Vogel	said.

Lewis	pressed	a	button	on	her	headset.	“Houst-	er...	Jiuquan,	probe	docking
complete.	No	complications.”

“Glad	to	hear	it,	Hermes,”	came	Mitch's	voice	over	the	comm.	“Report	status	of
al	supplies	once	you	get	them	aboard	and	inspected.”

“Roger	Jiuquan,”	Lewis	said.

Taking	off	her	headset,	she	turned	to	Martinez	and	Johanssen.	“Unload	the	probe
and	stow	the	supplies.	I'm	going	to	help	Beck	and

Vogel	de-suit.”

Martinez	and	Johanssen	floated	down	the	hal	toward	docking	port	A.

“So,”	he	said,	“who	would	you	have	eaten	first?”

She	glared	at	him.

“Cause	I	think	I'd	be	tastiest,”	he	continued,	flexing	his	arm.	“Look	at	that.	Good
solid	muscle	there.”

“You're	not	funny.”

“I'm	free	range,	you	know.	Corn-fed.”

She	shook	her	head	and	accelerated	down	the	hal.

“Come	on!	I	thought	you	liked	Mexican!”

“Not	listening,”	she	caled	back.

I'm	finaly	done	with	the	rover	modifications!

The	hard	part	was	figuring	out	how	to	maintain	life	support.	Everything	else	was
just	hard	work.	A	lot	of	hard	work.

I	haven't	been	good	at	keeping	the	log	up	to	date,	so	here's	a	recap:

First	I	had	to	finish	driling	holes	with	the	Pathfinder-murderin'	dril.	Then	I
chiseled	out	a	bilion	little	chunks	between	the	holes.	Ok,	it	was	749	but	it	felt
like	a	bilion.

Then	I	had	one	big	hole	in	the	trailer.	I	filed	down	the	edges	to	keep	them	from
being	too	sharp.

Remember	the	pop-tents?	I	cut	the	bottom	out	of	one	and	the	remaining	canvas
was	the	right	size	and	shape.	I	used	seal-strips	to

attach	it	to	the	inside	of	the	trailer.	After	pressurizing	and	sealing	up	leaks	as	I
found	them,	I	had	a	nice	big	baloon	bulging	out	of	the	trailer.

The	pressurized	area	is	easily	big	enough	to	fit	the	Oxygenator	and	Atmospheric
Regulator.

The	regulator	has	an	external	component	imaginatively	named	the	“Atmospheric
Regulator	External	Component.”	The	regulator	pumps

air	to	the	AREC	to	let	Mars	freeze	it.	It	does	this	along	a	tube	that	runs	through	a
valve	in	the	Hab's	wal.	The	return	air	comes	back

through	another	tube	just	like	it.

Getting	the	tubing	through	the	baloon	canvas	wasn't	too	hard.	I	have	several
spare	valve	patches.	Basicaly	they're	10x10cm	patches	of

Hab	canvas	with	a	valve	in	the	middle.	Why	do	I	have	these?	Consider	what
would	happen	on	a	normal	mission	if	the	regulator	valve

broke.	They'd	have	to	scrub	the	whole	mission.	Easier	to	send	spares.

The	AREC	is	fairly	smal.	I	made	a	shelf	for	it	just	under	the	solar	panel	shelves.
The	tubing	and	shelf	are	ready	for	when	I	eventualy

move	the	AREC	over.

There's	stil	a	lot	to	do.

I'm	not	in	any	hurry;	I've	been	taking	it	slow.	One	4-hour	EVA	per	day	spent	on
work,	the	rest	of	the	time	to	relax	In	the	Hab.	Plus,	I'l	take	a	day	off	every	now
and	then,	especialy	if	my	back	hurts.	I	can't	afford	to	injure	myself	now.

I'l	try	to	be	better	about	this	log.	Now	that	I	might	actualy	get	rescued,	people
wil	probably	read	it.	I'l	be	more	diligent	and	log	every	day.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	380

I	finished	the	heat	reservoir.

Remember	my	experiments	with	the	RTG	and	having	a	hot	bath?	Same
principle,	but	I	came	up	with	an	improvement:	Submerge	the

RTG.	No	heat	wil	be	wasted	that	way.

I	started	with	a	Large	Rigid	Sample	Container	(or	“plastic	box”	to	people	who
don't	work	at	NASA).	I	ran	a	tube	through	the	open

top	and	down	the	inside	wal.	Then	I	coiled	it	in	the	bottom	to	make	a	spiral.	I
glued	it	in	place	like	that,	and	sealed	the	end.	Using	my	smalest	dril	bit,	I	put
dozens	of	little	holes	in	the	coil.	The	idea	is	for	the	return	air	to	pass	through	the
water	as	a	bunch	of	little	bubbles.

The	increased	surface	area	wil	get	the	heat	in	to	the	air	better.

Then	I	got	a	Medium	Flexible	Sample	Container	(“Ziploc	bag”)	and	tried	to	seal
the	RTG	in	it.	But	the	RTG	has	an	irregular	shape,	and

I	couldn't	get	al	the	air	out	of	the	bag.	I	can't	alow	any	air	in	there.	Instead	of
heat	going	to	the	water,	some	would	get	stored	in	the	air,	which	could	superheat
and	melt	the	bag.

I	tried	a	bunch	of	times,	but	there	was	always	an	air	pocket	I	couldn't	get	out.	I
was	getting	pretty	frustrated	until	I	remembered	I	have	an	airlock.

Suiting	up,	I	went	to	Airlock	2	and	depressurized	to	a	ful	vacuum.	I	plopped	the
RTG	in	the	bag	and	closed	it.	Perfect	vacuum	seal.

Next	came	some	testing.	I	put	the	bagged	RTG	at	the	bottom	of	the	container	and
filed	it	with	water.	It	holds	20L,	and	the	RTG

quickly	heated	it.	It	was	gaining	a	degree	per	minute.	I	let	it	go	until	it	was	a
good	40C.	Then	I	hooked	up	the	regulator's	return	air	line	to	my	contraption	and
watched	the	results.

It	worked	great!	The	air	bubbled	through,	just	like	I'd	hoped.	Even	better,	the
bubbles	agitated	the	water,	which	distributed	the	heat

evenly.

I	let	it	run	for	an	hour,	and	the	Hab	started	to	get	cold.	The	RTG's	heat	can't	keep
up	with	the	total	loss	from	the	Hab's	impressive

surface	area.	Not	a	problem.	I've	already	established	it's	plenty	to	keep	the	rover
warm.

I	reattached	the	return	air	line	to	the	regulator	and	things	got	back	to	normal.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	381

I've	been	thinking	about	laws	on	Mars.

Yeah,	I	know,	it's	a	stupid	thing	to	think	about,	but	I	have	a	lot	of	free	time.

There's	an	international	treaty	saying	no	country	can	lay	claim	to	anything	that's
not	on	Earth.	And	by	another	treaty,	if	you're	not	in	any	country's	territory,
maritime	law	applies.

So	Mars	is	“international	waters.”

NASA	is	an	American	non-military	organization,	and	it	owns	the	Hab.	So	while
I'm	in	the	Hab,	American	law	applies.	As	soon	as	I

step	outside,	I'm	in	international	waters.	Then	when	I	get	in	the	Rover,	I'm	back
to	American	law.

Here's	the	cool	part:	I	wil	eventualy	go	to	Schiapareli	crater	and	commandeer	the
Ares	4	lander.	Nobody	explicitly	gave	me

permission	to	do	this,	and	they	can't	until	I'm	aboard	Ares	4	and	operating	the
comm	system.	After	I	board	Ares	4,	before	talking	to

NASA,	I	wil	take	control	of	a	craft	in	international	waters	without	permission.

That	makes	me	a	pirate!

A	Space	Pirate!

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	383

You	may	be	wondering	what	I	do	with	my	free	time.	I	spent	a	lot	of	it	sitting
around	on	my	lazy	ass	watching	TV.	But	so	do	you,	so

don't	judge.

Also,	I	plan	my	trip.

Pathfinder	was	a	cake	run.	Flat,	level	ground	al	the	way.	The	only	problem	was
navigating.	But	the	trip	to	Schiapareli	wil	mean	going

over	massive	elevation	changes.

I	have	a	rough	satelite	map	of	the	whole	planet.	It	doesn't	have	much	detail,	but
I'm	lucky	to	have	it	at	al.	NASA	didn't	expect	me	to

wander	3200km	from	the	Hab.

Acidalia	Planitia	(Where	I	am)	has	a	relatively	low	elevation.	So	does
Schiapareli.	But	between	them	it	goes	up	and	down	by	10km.

There's	going	to	be	a	lot	of	dangerous	driving.

Things	wil	be	smooth	while	I'm	in	Acidalia,	but	that's	only	the	first	650km.	After
that	comes	the	crater-riddled	terrain	of	Arabia	Terra.

I	do	have	one	thing	going	for	me.	And	I	swear	it's	a	gift	form	God.	For	some
geological	reason,	there's	a	valey	caled	Mawrth	Valis

that's	perfectly	placed.

Milions	of	years	ago	it	was	a	river.	Now	its	valey	that	juts	in	to	the	brutal	terrain
of	Arabia	almost	directly	toward	Sciapareli.	It's	much	gentler	terrain	than	the	rest
of	Arabia	Terra,	and	the	far	end	looks	like	a	smooth	ascent	out	of	the	valey.

Between	Acidalia	and	Mawrth	Valis	I'l	get	1350km	of	relatively	easy	terrain.

The	other	1850km...	wel	that	won't	be	so	nice.	Especialy	when	I	have	to	descend
in	to	Schiapareli	itself.	Ugh.

Anyway.	Mawrth	Valis.	Awesome.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	385

The	worst	part	of	the	Pathfinder	trip	was	being	trapped	in	the	rover.	I	had	to	live
in	a	cramped	environment	that	was	ful	of	junk	and

reeked	of	body	odor.	Same	as	my	colege	days.

Rim	shot!

Seriously	though,	it	sucked.	It	was	22	sols	of	abject	misery.

I	plan	to	leave	for	Schiapareli	100	sols	before	my	rescue	(or	death),	and	I	swear
to	fucking	God	I'l	rip	my	own	face	off	if	I	have	to	live	in	the	rover	for	that	long.

I	need	a	place	to	stay	where	I	can	stand	up	and	take	a	few	steps	without	hitting
things.	And	no,	being	outside	in	a	goddamn	EVA	suit

doesn't	count.	I	need	personal	space,	not	50kg	of	clothing.

So	today,	I	started	making	a	tent.	Somewhere	I	can	relax	while	the	batteries

recharge;	somewhere	I	can	lay	comfortably	while	sleeping.

I	recently	sacrificed	one	of	my	two	pop	tents	to	be	the	trailer	baloon.	The	other	is
in	perfect	shape.	Even	better,	it	has	an	attachment	for	the	rover's	airlock.	Before	I
made	it	a	potato	farm,	its	original	purpose	was	a	lifeboat	for	the	rover.

I	could	attach	the	pop	tent	to	either	vehicle's	airlock.	I'm	going	with	the	rover
instead	of	the	trailer.	The	rover	has	the	computer	and	controls.	If	I	need	to	know
status	of	anything	(like	life	support	or	how	wel	the	battery	is	charging)	I'l	need
access.	This	way,	I'l	be	able	to	walk	right	in.	No	EVA.

Also,	while	traveling,	I'l	keep	it	folded	up	in	the	rover.	In	an	emergency,	I	can
get	to	it	fast.

The	pop	tent	is	the	basis	of	my	“bedroom,”	but	not	the	whole	thing.	It's	not	very
big;	not	much	more	space	than	the	rover.	But	it	has	the	airlock	attachment	so	it's
a	great	place	to	start.	My	plan	is	to	double	the	floor	area	and	double	the	height.
That'l	give	me	a	nice	big	space	to	relax	in.

Hab	canvas	is	flexible.	When	you	fil	it	with	pressure,	it	wants	to	become	a
sphere.	That's	not	a	useful	shape.	So	the	Hab	and	the	pop-

tents	have	special	flooring	material.	It	unfolds	as	a	bunch	of	little	segments	that
won't	open	beyond	180	degrees	so	it	remains	flat.

The	pop	tent	base	is	a	hexagon.	I	have	another	base	left	over	from	what	is	now
the	trailer	baloon.	So	when	it's	done,	my	bedroom	wil

be	two	adjacent	hexes	with	wals	around	them	and	a	crude	ceiling.

It's	gonna	take	a	lot	of	glue	to	make	this	happen.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	387

The	pop	tent	is	1.2m	tal.	It's	not	made	for	comfort.	It's	made	for	astronauts	to
cower	in	while	their	crewmates	rescue	them.	I	want	2

meters.	I	want	to	be	able	to	stand!	I	don't	think	that's	too	much	to	ask.

On	paper,	it's	not	hard	to	do.	I	just	need	to	cut	canvas	pieces	to	the	right	shapes,

seal	them	together,	then	seal	them	to	the	existing

canvas	and	flooring.

But	that's	a	lot	of	canvas.	I	started	this	mission	with	6	square	meters	and	I've
used	most	of	that	up.	Mostly	on	sealing	the	breach	from	when	the	Hab	blew	up.

Goddamn	Airlock	1.

Anyway,	my	bedroom	wil	take	30	square	meters	of	the	stuff.	Way	the	hel	more
than	I	have	left.	Fortunately,	I	have	an	alternate	supply

of	Hab	canvas:	The	Hab.

Problem	is	(folow	me	closely	here,	the	science	is	pretty	complicated)	if	I	cut	a
hole	in	the	Hab,	the	air	won't	stay	inside	anymore.

I'l	have	to	depressurize	the	Hab,	cut	chunks	out,	and	put	it	back	together
(smaler).	I	spent	today	figuring	out	the	exact	sizes	and

shapes	of	canvas	I'l	need.	I	needed	to	not	fuck	this	up,	so	I	triple-checked
everything.	I	even	made	a	model	out	of	paper.

The	Hab	is	a	dome.	If	I	take	canvas	from	near	the	floor,	I	can	pul	the	remaining
canvas	down	and	re-seal	it.	The	Hab	wil	become	a

lopsided	dome,	but	that	shouldn't	matter.	As	long	as	it	holds	pressure.	I	only
need	it	to	last	another	62	sols.

I	drew	the	shapes	on	the	wal	with	a	Sharpie.	Then	I	spent	a	long	time	re-
measuring	them	and	making	sure,	over	and	over,	that	they

were	right.

That	was	al	I	did	today.	Might	not	seem	like	much,	but	the	math	and	design	work
took	al	day.	Now	it's	time	for	dinner.

I've	been	eating	potatoes	for	weeks.	Theoreticaly,	with	my	3/4	ration	plan,	I
should	stil	be	eating	food	packs.	But	3/4	ration	is	hard	to	maintain,	so	now	I'm
eating	potatoes.

I	have	enough	to	last	til	launch,	so	I	won't	starve.	But	I'm	pretty	damn	sick	of
potatoes.	Also,	they	have	a	lot	of	fiber,	so...	let's	just	say	it's	good	I'm	the	only
guy	on	this	planet.

I	saved	5	meal	packs	for	special	occasions.	I	wrote	their	names	on	each	one.	I	get
to	eat	“Departure”	the	day	I	leave	for	Schiapareli.

I'l	eat	“Half-way”	when	I	reach	the	1600km	mark,	and	“Arrival”	when	I	get
there.

The	fourth	one	is	“Survived	Something	That	Should	Have	Kiled	Me”	because
some	fucking	thing	wil	happen,	I	just	know	it.	I	don't

know	what	it'l	be,	but	it'l	happen.	The	rover	wil	break	down	or	I'l	come	down
with	Fatal	Hemorrhoids	or	I'l	run	in	to	hostile	Martians	or	some	shit.	When	I	do
(if	I	live)	I	get	to	eat	that	meal	pack.

The	fifth	one	is	reserved	for	the	day	I	launch.	It's	labeled	“Last	Meal.”

Maybe	that's	not	such	a	good	name.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	388

I	started	the	day	with	a	potato.	I	washed	it	down	with	some	Martian	Coffee.
That's	my	name	for	“hot	water	with	a	caffeine	pil

dissolved	in	it.”	I	ran	out	of	real	coffee	months	ago.

My	first	order	of	business	was	a	careful	inventory	of	the	Hab.	I	needed	to	root
out	anything	that	would	have	a	problem	with	losing

atmospheric	pressure.	Of	course,	everything	in	the	Hab	had	a	crash	course	in
depressurization	a	few	months	back.	But	this	time	would	be

controled	and	I	might	as	wel	do	it	right.

The	main	thing	is	the	water.	I	lost	300L	to	sublimation	when	the	Hab	blew	up.
This	time,	that	won't	happen.	I	drained	the	Water

Reclaimer	and	sealed	al	the	tanks.

The	rest	was	just	colecting	knickknacks	and	dumping	them	in	Airlock	3.
Anything	I	could	think	of	that	doesn't	do	wel	in	a	near-

vacuum.	The	three	remaining	laptops,	al	the	pens,	the	vitamin	bottles	(probably
not	necessary	but	I'm	not	taking	chances),	medical	supplies,	etc.

Then	I	did	a	controled	shutdown	of	the	Hab.	The	critical	components	are
designed	to	survive	a	vacuum.	Hab	depress	is	one	of	the

many	scenarios	NASA	accounted	for.	One	system	at	a	time,	I	cleanly	shut	them
al	down,	ending	with	the	main	computer	itself.

I	suited	up	and	depressurized	the	Hab.	Last	time,	the	canvas	colapsed	and	made
a	mess	of	everything.	That's	not	supposed	to	happen.

The	dome	of	the	Hab	is	mostly	supported	by	air	pressure,	but	there	are	flexible
reenforcing	poles	across	the	inside	to	hold	the	canvas	up.

It's	how	the	Hab	was	assembled	in	the	first	place.

I	watched	as	the	canvas	gently	settled	on	to	the	poles.	To	confirm	the	depress,	I
opened	both	doors	of	Airlock	2.	I	left	Airlock	3	alone.

It	maintained	pressure	for	its	cargo	of	random	crap.

Then	I	cut	shit	up!

I'm	not	a	materials	engineer;	my	design	for	the	bedroom	isn't	elegant.	It's	just	a
2m	perimeter	and	a	ceiling.	No,	it	won't	have	right

angles	and	corners	(pressure	vessels	don't	like	those).	It'l	baloon	out	to	a	more
round	shape.

Anyway,	it	means	I	only	needed	to	cut	two	big-ass	strips	of	canvas.	One	for	the
wals	and	one	for	the	ceiling.

After	mangling	the	Hab,	I	puled	the	remaining	canvas	down	to	the	flooring	and
re-sealed	it.	Ever	set	up	a	camping	tent?	From	the

inside?	While	wearing	a	suit	of	armor?	It	was	a	pain	in	the	ass.

I	repressurized	to	1/20th	of	an	atmosphere	to	see	if	it	could	hold	pressure.

Ha	ha	ha!	Of	course	it	couldn't!	Leaks	galore.	Time	to	find	them.

On	Earth,	tiny	particles	get	attached	to	water	or	wear	down	to	nothing.	On	Mars,
they	just	hang	around.	The	top	layer	of	sand	is	like

talcum	powder.	I	went	outside	with	a	bag	and	scraped	along	the	surface.	I	got
some	normal	sand,	but	plenty	of	powder	too.

I	had	the	Hab	maintain	the	1/20th	atmosphere,	backfiling	as	air	leaked	out.	Then
I	“puffed”	the	bag	to	get	the	smalest	particles	to	float	around.	They	were	quickly
drawn	to	where	the	leaks	were.	As	I	found	each	leak,	I	spot-sealed	it	with	resin.

It	took	hours,	but	I	finaly	got	a	good	seal.	I'l	tel	ya,	the	Hab	looks	pretty	“ghetto”
now.	One	whole	side	of	it	is	lower	than	the	rest.	I'l	have	to	hunch	down	when	I'm
over	there.

I	pressurized	to	a	ful	atmosphere	and	waited	an	hour.	No	leaks.

It's	been	a	long,	physicaly	taxing	day.	I'm	totaly	exhausted	but	I	can't	sleep.
Every	sound	scares	the	shit	out	of	me.	Is	that	the	Hab

popping?	No?	Ok...	What	was	that!?	Oh,	nothing?	Ok...

It's	a	terrible	thing	to	have	my	life	depend	on	my	half-assed	handiwork.

Time	to	get	a	sleeping	pil	from	the	medical	supplies.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	389

What	the	fuck	is	in	those	sleeping	pils!?	It's	the	middle	of	the	day.

After	two	cups	of	Martian	Coffee,	I	woke	up	a	little.	I	won't	be	taking	another
one	of	those	pils.	It's	not	like	I	have	to	go	to	work	in	the	morning.

Anyway,	as	you	can	tel	from	how	not	dead	I	am,	the	Hab	stayed	sealed
overnight.	The	seal	is	solid.	Ugly	as	hel,	but	solid.

Today's	task	was	the	bedroom.

Assembling	the	bedroom	was	way	easier	than	re-sealing	the	Hab.	Because	this
time,	I	didn't	have	to	wear	an	EVA	suit.	I	made	the

whole	thing	inside	the	Hab.	Why	not?	It's	just	canvas.	I	can	rol	it	up	and	take	it
out	an	airlock	when	I'm	done.

First,	I	did	some	surgery	on	the	remaining	pop	tent.	I	needed	to	keep	the	rover-
airlock	connector	and	surrounding	canvas.	The	rest	of

the	canvas	had	to	go.	Why	hack	off	most	of	the	canvas	only	to	replace	it	with
more	canvas?	Seams.

NASA	is	good	at	making	things.	I	am	not.	The	dangerous	part	of	this	structure
won't	be	the	canvas.	It'l	be	the	seams.	And	I	get	less

total	seam	length	by	not	trying	to	use	the	existing	pop-tent	canvas.

After	hacking	away	most	of	the	remaining	tent,	I	seal-stripped	the	two	pop-tent
floors	together.	Then	I	sealed	the	new	canvas	pieces	in

to	place.

It	was	so	much	easier	without	the	EVA	suit	on.	So	much	easier!

Then	I	had	to	test	it.	Again,	I	did	it	in	the	Hab.	I	brought	an	EVA	suit	in	to	the
tent	with	me	and	closed	the	mini-airlock	door.	Then	I	fired	up	the	EVA	suit,
leaving	the	helmet	off.	I	told	it	to	bump	the	pressure	up	to	1.2	atm.

It	took	a	little	while	to	bring	it	up	to	par,	and	I	had	to	disable	some	alarms	on	the
suit.	(“Hey,	I'm	pretty	sure	the	helmet's	not	on!”).	It	depleted	most	of	the	N2
tank,	but	was	finaly	able	to	bring	the	pressure	up.

Then	I	sat	around	and	waited.	I	breathed,	the	suit	regulated	the	air.	Al	was	wel.	I
watched	the	suit	readouts	carefuly	to	see	if	it	had	to	replace	any	“lost”	air.	After
an	hour	with	no	noticeable	change,	I	declared	the	first	test	a	success.

I	roled	up	the	whole	thing	(wadded	up,	realy)	and	took	it	out	to	the	rover.

You	know,	I	suit	up	a	lot	these	days.	I	bet	that's	another	record	I	hold.	A	typical
Martian	astronaut	does,	what,	40	EVAs?	I've	done

several	hundred.

Once	I	brought	the	bedroom	to	the	rover,	I	attached	it	to	the	airlock	from	the
inside.	Then	I	puled	the	release	to	let	it	loose.	I	was	stil	wearing	my	EVA	suit,
cause	I'm	not	an	idiot.

It	fired	out	and	filed	in	three	seconds.	The	open	airlock	hatchway	led	directly	to
the	bedroom,	and	it	appeared	to	be	holding	pressure.

Just	like	before,	I	let	it	sit	for	an	hour.	And	just	like	before,	it	worked	great.
Unlike	the	Hab	canvas	resealing,	I	got	this	one	right	on	the	first	try.	Mostly
because	I	didn't	have	to	do	it	with	a	damn	EVA	suit	on.

Originaly	I	planned	to	let	it	sit	overnight	and	check	in	the	morning.	But	I	ran	in
to	a	problem:	I	can't	get	out	if	I	do	that.	The	rover	only	has	one	airlock,	and	the
bedroom	was	attached	to	it.	There	was	no	way	for	me	to	get	out	without
detaching	the	bedroom,	and	no	way	to

attach	and	pressurize	the	bedroom	without	being	inside	the	rover.

It's	a	little	scary.	The	first	time	I	test	the	thing	overnight	wil	be	with	me	in	it.	But
that'l	be	later.	I've	done	enough	today.

I	have	to	face	facts.	I'm	done	with	the	rover.	I	don't	“feel”	like	I'm	done.	But	it's

I'm	leaving	here	on	Sol	449.	That	gives	me	59	sols	to	test	everything	and	fix

anything	important	I	forgot.

Since	Sol	6	al	I've	wanted	to	do	was	get	the	hel	out	of	here.	Now	the	prospect	of
leaving	the	Hab	behind	scares	the	shit	out	of	me.	I

need	some	encouragement.	I	need	to	ask	myself:	“What	would	an	Apolo
astronaut	do?”

He'd	drink	3	whiskey	sours,	bang	his	mistress,	then	fly	to	the	moon.	And	if	he
ever	met	a	botanist	like	me	he'd	dispense	a	wedgie	on

principle.

I'm	working	out	how	to	pack.	It's	harder	than	it	sounds.

I	have	two	pressure	vessels:	The	rover	and	the	trailer.	They're	connected	by
hoses,	but	they're	also	not	stupid.	If	one	loses	pressure,

the	other	wil	instantly	seal	off	the	shared	lines.

There's	a	grim	logic	to	this:	If	the	rover	breaches	I'm	dead.	No	point	in	planning
around	that.	But	if	the	trailer	breaches,	I'l	be	fine.	That	means	I	should	put
everything	important	in	the	rover.	If	I'm	going	to	die,	I	may	as	wel	take	al	the
delicate	stuff	with	me.

Everything	that	goes	in	the	trailer	has	to	be	comfortable	in	near-vacuum	and
freezing	temperatures.	Not	that	I	anticipate	that,	but	you

know.	Plan	for	the	worst.

There	isn't	much	room	to	spare.	It'l	have	two	bulky	Hab	batteries,	the
Atmospheric	Regulator,	the	Oxygenator	and	my	home-made

heat	reservoir.	It	would	be	more	convenient	to	have	the	reservoir	in	the	rover,	but
it	has	to	be	near	the	Regulator's	return	air	feed.

It'l	be	cramped,	but	there	wil	be	some	empty	spaces.	And	I	know	just	how	to	fil
them:	Taters!

Nothing	“bad”	can	happen	to	the	potatoes.	They're	already	dead.	I've	been
storing	them	outside	for	months	anyway.	Also,	they're	smal

and	not	delicate.	They	probably	won't	al	fit,	so	some	wil	have	to	ride	with	me.

The	rover	wil	be	pretty	packed,	too.	When	I'm	driving,	I'l	keep	the	bedroom
folded	up	near	the	airlock,	ready	for	emergency	egress.

Also,	I'l	have	the	two	functional	EVA	suits	in	there	with	me	and	anything	that
might	be	needed	for	emergency	repairs:	Tool	kits,	spare

parts,	my	nearly	depleted	supply	of	sealant,	the	other	rover's	main	computer	(just
in	case!)	and	al	620	glorious	liters	of	water.

And	a	plastic	box	to	to	serve	as	a	toilet.	One	with	a	good	lid.

“How's	Watney	doing?”	Venkat	asked.

Mindy	looked	up	from	her	computer	with	a	start.	“Dr.	Kapoor?”

“I	hear	you	caught	a	pic	of	him	during	an	EVA?”

“Uh,	yeah,”	Mindy	said,	typing	on	her	keyboard.	“I	noticed	things	would	always
change	around	9am	local	time.	People	usualy	keep

the	same	patterns	so	I	figured	he	likes	to	start	work	around	then.	I	did	some
minor	realignment	to	get	seventeen	pics	between	9:00	and

9:10.	He	showed	up	in	one	of	them.”

“Good	thinking.	Can	I	see	the	pic?”

“Sure,”	she	said.	She	brought	up	the	image	on	her	screen.

Venkat	peered	at	the	blurry	image.	“Is	this	as	good	as	it	gets?”

“Wel	it	is	a	photo	taken	from	orbit,”	Mindy	said.	“The	NSA	enhanced	the	image
with	the	best	software	they	have.”

“Wait,	What?”	Venkat	stammered.	“The	NSA?”

“Yeah,	they	caled	and	offered	to	help	out.	Same	software	they	use	for	enhancing
spy	satelite	imagery.”

Venkat	shrugged.	“It's	amazing	how	much	red	tape	gets	cut	when	everyone's
rooting	for	one	man	to	survive.”	He	pointed	to	the	screen.

“What's	Watney	doing	here?”

“I	think	he's	loading	something	into	the	rover.”

“When	was	the	last	time	he	worked	on	the	trailer?”	Venkat	asked.

“Not	for	a	while.	Why	doesn't	he	write	us	notes	more	often?”

Venkat	shrugged.	“He's	busy.	He	works	most	of	the	daylight	hours,	and
arranging	rocks	to	spel	a	message	takes	time	and	energy.”

“So...”	Mindy	said.	“Why'd	you	come	here	in	person?	We	could	have	done	al
this	over	email.”

“Actualy,	I	came	to	talk	to	you,”	he	said.	“There's	going	to	be	a	change	in	your
responsibilities.	From	now	on,	instead	of	managing	the

satelites	around	Mars,	your	sole	responsibility	is	watching	Mark	Watney.”

“What?”	Mindy	said.	“What	about	course	corrections	and	alignment?”

“We'l	assign	that	to	other	people,”	Venkat	said.	“From	now	on,	your	only	focus
is	examining	imagery	of	Ares	3.”

“That's	a	demotion,”	Mindy	said.	“I'm	an	orbital	engineer,	and	you're	turning	me
in	to	a	glorified	Peeping	Tom.”

“It's	short-term,”	Venkat	said.	“And	we'l	make	it	up	to	you.	Thing	is,	you've	been
doing	it	for	months	and	you're	an	expert	at

identifying	elements	of	Ares	3	from	satelite	pics.	We	don't	have	anyone	else	who
can	do	that.”

“Why	is	this	suddenly	so	important?”

“He's	running	out	of	time,”	Venkat	said.	“We	don't	know	how	far	along	he	is	on
the	rover	modifications.	But	we	do	know	he's	on	only

got	16	sols	to	get	them	done.	We	need	to	know	exactly	what	he's	doing.	I've	got
media	outlets	and	senators	asking	for	his	status	al	the

time.	The	President	even	caled	me	a	couple	of	times.

“But	seeing	his	status	doesn't	help,”	Mindy	said.	“It's	not	like	we	can	do
anything	about	it	if	he	fals	behind.	This	is	a	pointless	task.”

“How	long	have	you	worked	for	the	government?”	Venkat	sighed.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	434

The	time	has	come	to	test	this	shit	out.

This	presents	a	problem.	Unlike	my	Pathfinder	trip,	I	have	to	take	vital	life
support	elements	out	of	the	Hab.	When	you	take	the

Atmospheric	Regulator	and	Oxygenator	out	of	the	Hab,	you're	left	with...	a	tent.
A	big	round	tent	that	can't	support	life.

It's	not	as	risky	as	it	seems.	As	always,	the	dangerous	part	about	life	support	is
managing	carbon	dioxide.	When	the	air	gets	to	1%

CO2,	you	start	getting	symptoms	of	poisoning.	So	I	need	to	keep	it	below	that.

The	Hab's	internal	volume	is	about	120,000L.	Breathing	normaly,	it	would	take
me	over	two	days	to	bring	the	CO2	level	up	to	1%

(and	I	wouldn't	even	dent	in	the	O2	level).	So	it's	safe	to	move	the	Regulator	and
Oxygenator	over	for	a	while.

Both	are	way	too	big	to	fit	through	the	trailer	airlock.	Lucky	for	me,	they	came
to	Mars	with	“some	assembly	required”.	They	were	too

big	to	send	whole,	so	they're	easy	to	dismantle.

Over	several	trips,	I	took	al	their	chunks	to	the	trailer.	I	brought	each	chunk	in
through	the	airlock,	one	at	a	time.	It	was	a	pain	in	the	ass	reassembling	them
inside,	let	me	tel	you.	There's	barely	enough	room	for	al	the	shit	it's	got	to	hold.
There	wasn't	much	left	for	our	intrepid	hero.

Then	I	got	the	AREC.	It	sat	outside	the	Hab	like	an	AC	unit	might	on	Earth.	In	a
way,	that's	what	it	was.	I	hauled	it	over	to	the	trailer	and	lashed	it	to	the	shelf	I'd
made	for	it.	Then	I	hooked	it	up	to	the	feed	lines	that	led	through	the	“baloon”	to
the	inside	of	the	trailer's	pressure	vessel.

The	Regulator	needs	to	send	air	to	the	AREC	then	the	return	air	needs	to	bubble
through	the	heat	reservoir.	And,	it	needs	a	pressure

tank	to	dump	the	CO2	it	puls	from	the	air.

When	gutting	the	trailer	to	make	room,	I	left	one	tank	in	place	for	this.	It's
supposed	to	hold	oxygen,	but	a	tank's	a	tank.	Thank	God	al	the	air	lines	and
valves	are	standardized	across	the	mission.	That's	no	mistake.	It's	a	deliberate
decision	for	maintenance	purposes.	We	could	fix	things	in	the	field	easier	that
way.

Once	everything	assembled,	I	hooked	them	in	to	the	trailer's	power	and	watched
them	power	up.	I	ran	both	through	ful	diagnostics	to

confirm	they	were	working	correctly.	Then	I	shut	down	the	Oxygenator.
Remember,	I'l	only	use	it	one	sol	out	of	every	5.

I	moved	to	the	rover,	which	means	I	had	to	do	an	annoying	10-meter	EVA.	From
there	I	monitored	the	life	support	situation.	It's	worth

noting	that	I	can't	monitor	the	actual	support	equipment	from	the	rover	(it's	al	in
the	trailer),	but	the	rover	can	tel	me	al	about	the	air.

Oxygen,	CO2,	temperature,	humidity,	etc.	Everything	seemed	ok.

Getting	back	in	to	the	EVA	suit,	I	released	a	canister	of	CO2	in	to	the	rover's	air.
I	watched	the	rover	computer	have	a	shit-fit	when	it	saw	the	CO2	spike	to	lethal
levels.	Then,	over	time,	the	levels	dropped	to	normal.	The	regulator	was	doing
its	job.	Good	boy!

I	left	the	equipment	running	when	I	returned	to	the	Hab.	It'l	be	on	its	own	al
night	and	I'l	check	it	in	the	morning.	It's	not	a	true	test,	because	I'm	not	there	to
breathe	up	the	oxygen	and	make	CO2,	but	one	step	at	a	time.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	435

Last	night	was	weird.	I	knew	logically	that	nothing	bad	would	happen	in	just	one
night,	but	it	was	a	little	unnerving	to	know	I	had	no	life	support	other	than
heaters.	My	life	depended	on	some	math	I	did	earlier.	If	I	dropped	a	sign	or
added	two	numbers	wrong,	I	might

never	wake	up.

But	I	did	wake	up,	and	the	main	computer	showed	the	slight	rise	in	CO2	I	had
predicted.	Looks	like	I	live	another	Sol.

“Live	Another	Sol”	would	be	an	awesome	name	for	a	James	Bond	movie.

I	checked	up	on	the	rover.	Everything	was	fine.	If	I	don't	drive	it,	a	single	charge
of	the	batteries	could	keep	the	regulator	going	for	over	a	month	(with	the	heater
off).	It's	a	pretty	good	safety	margin	to	have.	If	al	hel	breaks	loose	on	my	trip	I'l
have	time	to	fix	things.	I'd	be	limited	by	oxygen	consumption	rather	than	CO2
removal,	and	I	have	plenty	of	oxygen.

I	decided	it	was	a	good	time	to	test	the	bedroom.

I	got	in	the	rover,	and	attached	the	bedroom	to	the	outer	airlock	door	from	the
inside.	Like	I	mentioned	before,	this	is	the	only	way	to	do	it.	Then	I	turned	it
loose	on	an	unsuspecting	Mars.

As	intended,	the	pressure	from	the	rover	blasted	the	canvas	outward	and	inflated
it.	After	that,	chaos.	The	sudden	pressure	popped	the

bedroom	like	a	baloon.	It	quickly	deflated,	leaving	both	itself	and	the	rover
devoid	of	air.	I	was	wearing	my	EVA	suit	at	the	time;	I'm	not	a	fucking	idiot.	So
I	get	to...

Live	Another	Sol!	(Starring	Mark	Watney	as	…	probably	Q.	I'm	no	James	Bond.)

I	dragged	the	popped	bedroom	in	to	the	Hab	and	gave	it	a	good	going-over.	It
failed	at	the	seam	where	the	wal	met	the	ceiling.	Makes

sense.	It's	a	right-angle	in	a	pressure	vessel.	Physics	hates	that	sort	of	thing.

First,	I	patched	it	up,	then	I	cut	strips	of	spare	canvas	to	place	over	the	seam.
Now	it	has	double-thickness	and	double	sealing	resin	al	around.	Maybe	that'l	be
enough.	At	this	point,	I'm	kind	of	guessing.	My	amazing	botany	skils	aren't
much	use	for	this.

I'l	test	it	again	tomorrow.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	436

I'm	out	of	caffeine	pils.	No	more	Martian	Coffee	for	me.

So	it	took	a	little	longer	for	me	to	wake	up	this	morning,	and	I	spent	most	of	the
day	with	a	headache.	One	nice	thing	about	living	in	a	multi-bilion	dolar	mansion
on	Mars:	Access	to	pure	oxygen.	For	some	reason,	a	high	concentration	of	O2
wil	kil	most	headaches.	Don't

know	why.	Don't	care.	The	important	thing	is	I	don't	have	to	suffer.

I	tested	out	the	bedroom	again.	I	used	the	same	process	as	yesterday.	This	time	it
held.	So	is	that	good?	I	don't	know.	That's	the	shitty	part	of	failure	analysis.	If
the	bedroom	fails	while	I'm	sleeping	in	it,	I'l	die.	How	long	wil	it	last?

Hopefuly,	if	it	developed	a	leak,	it'd	be	slow	enough	that	I	could	react.	But	you
never	know.

After	a	few	minutes	standing	around	in	my	EVA	suit,	I	decided	to	make	better
use	of	my	time.	I	may	not	be	able	to	leave	while	the

bedroom	is	attached	to	the	airlock,	but	I	can	go	in	to	the	rover	and	close	the	door.

Once	I	did	that,	I	took	off	the	uncomfortable	EVA	suit.	The	bedroom	was	on	the
other	side	of	the	airlock	door,	stil	fuly	pressurized.

So	I'm	stil	running	my	test,	but	I	don't	have	to	wear	the	EVA	suit.

I	wanted	a	good	long	test	(I	arbitrarily	picked	8	hours)	so	I	was	trapped	in	the
rover	until	then.

I	spent	my	time	planning	the	trip.	There	wasn't	much	to	add	to	what	I	already
knew.	I'l	bee-line	to	Mawrth	Valis,	then	folow	it	until	it	ends.	It'l	take	me	on	a
zig-zag	route,	but	mostly	toward	Schiapareli.

After	that	comes	Arabia	Terra.	Each	crater	represents	two	brutal	elevation
changes.	First	down,	then	up.	I	did	my	best	to	find	the

shortest	path	around	them.	I'm	sure	I'l	have	to	adjust	the	course	when	I'm	actualy
driving	it.	No	plan	survives	first	contact	with	the	enemy.

Mitch	took	his	seat	in	the	conference	room.	The	usual	gang	was	there:	Teddy,
Venkat,	Mitch,	and	Annie.	But	this	time	there	was	also

Mindy	Park	as	wel	as	a	man	Mitch	had	never	seen	before.

“What's	up,	Venk?”	Mitch	asked.	“Why	the	sudden	meeting?”

“We've	got	some	developments,”	Venkat	said.	“Mindy,	why	don't	you	bring	them
up	to	date.”

“Uh,	yeah,”	Mindy	said.	“Looks	like	Watney	finished	the	baloon	addition	to	the
trailer.	It	mostly	uses	the	design	we	sent	him.”

“Any	idea	how	stable	it	is?”	Teddy	asked.

“Pretty	stable,”	she	said.	“It's	been	inflated	for	several	days	with	no	problems.
Also	he	built	some	kind	of...	room.”

“Room?”	Teddy	asked.

“It's	made	of	Hab	canvas,	I	think,”	Mindy	explained.	“It	attaches	to	the	rover's
airlock.	I	think	he	cut	a	section	out	of	the	Hab	to	make	it.	I	don't	know	what	it's
for.”

Teddy	turned	to	Venkat.	“Why	would	he	do	that?”

“We	think	it's	a	workshop,”	Venkat	said.	“There'l	be	a	lot	of	work	to	do	on	the
MAV	once	he	gets	to	Schiapareli.	It'l	be	easier

without	an	EVA	suit.	He	probably	plans	to	do	as	much	as	he	can	in	that	room.”

“Clever,”	Teddy	said.

“Watney's	a	clever	guy,”	Mitch	said.	“How	about	getting	life	support	in	there?”

“I	think	he's	done	it,”	Mindy	said.	“He	moved	the	AREC.”

“Sorry,”	Annie	interrupted.	“What's	an	AREC?”

“It's	the	external	component	of	the	Atmospheric	Regulator,”	Mindy	said.	“It	sits
outside	the	Hab,	so	I	know	when	it	disappeared.	He

probably	mounted	it	on	the	rover.	There's	no	other	reason	to	move	it	so	I'm
guessing	he's	got	life	support	online.”

“Awesome,”	Mitch	said.	“Things	are	coming	together.”

“Don't	celebrate	yet,	Mitch,”	Venkat	said.	“This	is	Randal	Carter,	one	of	our
Martian	meteorologists.	Randal,	tel	them	what	you	told

me.”

Randal	nodded.	“Thank	you,	Dr.	Kapoor.”	He	turned	his	laptop	around	to	show	a
map	of	Mars.	“Over	the	past	few	weeks,	a	dust

storm	has	been	developing	in	Arabia	Terra.	Not	a	big	deal	in	terms	of	magnitude.
It	won't	hinder	his	driving	at	al.”

“So	what's	the	problem?”	Annie	asked.

“It's	a	low-velocity	dust	storm,”	Randal	Explained.	“Slow	winds,	but	fast	enough
to	pick	up	very	smal	particles	on	the	surface	and

whip	them	up	in	to	thick	clouds.	There	are	five	or	six	of	them	every	year.	The
thing	is,	they	last	for	months,	they	cover	huge	sections	of	the	planet,	and	they
make	the	atmosphere	thick	with	dust.”

“I	stil	don't	see	the	problem,”	Annie	said.

“Light,”	Randal	said.	“The	total	sunlight	reaching	the	surface	is	very	low	in	the
area	of	the	storm.	Right	now,	it's	20%	of	normal.	And

Watney's	rover	is	powered	by	solar	panels.”

“Shit,”	Mitch	said,	rubbing	his	eyes.	“And	we	can't	warn	him.”

“So	he	gets	less	power.”	Annie	said.	“Can't	he	just	recharge	longer?”

“The	current	plan	already	has	him	recharging	al	day	long,”	Venkat	explained.
“With	20%	of	normal	daylight,	it'l	take	five	times	as	long

to	get	the	same	energy.	It'l	turn	his	45	sol	trip	in	to	225	sols.	He'l	miss	the
Hermes	flyby.”

“Can't	Hermes	wait	for	him?”	Annie	asked.

“It's	a	flyby,”	Venkat	said.	“Hermes	isn't	going	in	to	Martian	orbit.	If	they	did,
they	wouldn't	be	able	to	get	back.	They	need	their

velocity	for	the	return	trajectory.”

After	a	few	moments	of	silence,	Teddy	said	“We'l	just	have	to	hope	he	finds	a
way	through.	We	can	track	his	progress	and-”

“No	we	can't,”	Mindy	interrupted.

“We	can't?”	Teddy	said.

She	shook	her	head.	“The	satelites	won't	be	able	to	see	through	the	dust.	Once	he
enters	the	affected	area,	we	won't	see	anything	until

he	comes	out	the	other	side.”

“Wel...”	Teddy	said.	“Shit.”

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	439

Before	I	risk	my	life	with	this	contraption,	I	need	to	test	it.

And	not	the	little	tests	I've	been	doing	so	far.	Sure,	I've	tested	power	generation,
life	support,	the	trailer	bubble,	and	the	bedroom.	But	I	need	to	test	al	aspects	of	it
working	together.

I'm	going	to	load	it	up	for	the	long	trip,	and	drive	in	circles.	I	won't	ever	be	more
than	500	meters	from	the	Hab,	so	I'l	be	fine	if	shit	breaks.

I	dedicated	today	to	loading	up	the	rover	and	trailer	for	the	test.	I	want	the
weight	to	match	what	it'l	be	on	the	real	trip.	Plus	if	cargo	is	going	to	shift	around
or	break	things	I	want	to	know	about	it	now.

I	made	one	concession	to	common	sense:	I	left	most	of	my	water	supply	in	the
Hab.	I	loaded	20	liters;	enough	for	the	test	but	no	more.

There	are	a	lot	of	ways	I	could	lose	pressure	in	this	mechanical	abomination	I've
created,	and	I	don't	want	al	my	water	to	boil	off	if	that	happens.

On	the	real	trip,	I'm	going	to	have	620L	of	water.	I	made	up	the	weight
difference	by	loading	600kg	of	rocks	in	with	my	other	supplies.

Back	on	Earth,	universities	and	governments	are	wiling	to	pay	milions	to	get
their	hands	on	Mars	rocks.	I'm	using	them	as	balast.

I'm	doing	one	more	little	test	tonight.	I	made	sure	the	batteries	were	good	and
ful,	then	disconnected	the	rover	and	trailer	from	Hab

power.	I'l	be	sleeping	in	the	Hab,	but	I	left	the	rover's	life	support	on.	It'l
maintain	the	air	overnight,	and	tomorrow	I'l	see	how	much	power	it	ate	up.	I've
watched	the	power	consumption	while	it's	attached	to	the	Hab	and	there	weren't
any	surprises.	But	this'l	be	the	true	proof.	I	cal	it	the	“Plugs-out	test.”

Maybe	that's	not	the	best	name.

The	crew	of	Hermes	gathered	in	The	Rec.

“Let's	get	through	status	quickly,”	Lewis	said.	“We're	al	behind	in	our	science
assignments.	Vogel,	you	first.”

“I	repaired	the	bad	cable	on	VASIMR	4,”	Vogel	reported.	“It	was	our	last	thick
gauge	cable.	If	another	such	problem	occurs,	we	wil

have	to	braid	lower	gauge	lines	to	carry	the	current.	Also,	the	power	output	from
the	reactor	is	declining.”

“Johanssen,”	Lewis	said.	“What	the	deal	with	the	reactor?”

“I	had	to	dial	it	back,”	Johanssen	said.	“It's	the	cooling	vanes.	They	aren't
radiating	heat	as	wel	as	they	used	to.	They're	tarnishing.”

“How	can	that	happen?”	Lewis	asked.	“They're	outside	the	craft.	There's	nothing
for	them	to	react	with.”

“I	think	they	picked	up	dust	or	smal	air	leaks	from	Hermes	itself.	One	way	or
another,	they're	definitely	tarnishing.	The	tarnish	is

connecting	the	micro-lattice,	and	that	reduces	the	surface	area.	Less	surface	area
means	less	heat	dissipation.	So	I	limited	the	reactor	enough	that	we	weren't

getting	positive	heat.”

“Any	chance	of	repairing	the	cooling	vanes?”

“It's	on	the	microscopic	scale,”	Johanssen	said.	“We'd	need	a	lab.	Usualy	they
replace	the	veins	after	each	mission.”

“Wil	we	be	able	to	maintain	engine	power	for	the	rest	of	the	mission?”

“Yes,	if	the	rate	of	tarnishing	doesn't	increase.”

“Al	right,	keep	an	eye	on	it.	Beck,	how's	life	support?”

“Limping,”	Beck	said.	“We've	been	in	space	way	longer	than	it	was	designed	to
handle.	There	are	a	bunch	of	filters	that	would	normaly

be	replaced	each	mission.	I	found	a	way	to	clean	them	with	a	chemical	bath	I
made	in	the	lab,	but	it	eats	away	at	the	filters	themselves.

We're	ok	right	now,	but	who	knows	what'l	break	next?”

“We	knew	this	would	happen,”	Lewis	said.	“This	ship	is	designed	for	a	396	day
mission,	and	we	need	to	make	it	last	898.	We've	got

al	of	NASA	to	help	when	things	break.	We	just	need	to	stay	on	top	of
maintenance.	Martinez,	what's	the	deal	with	your	bunkroom?”

Martinez	furrowed	his	brow.	“It's	stil	trying	to	cook	me.	The	climate	control	just
isn't	keeping	up.	I	think	it's	the	tubing	in	the	wals	that	brings	the	coolant.	I	can't
get	at	them	because	they're	built	in	to	the	hul.	We	can	use	the	room	for	storage	of
non-temperature-sensitive	cargo,	but	that's	about	it.”

“Where	have	you	been	sleeping?”

“In	Airlock	2.	It's	the	only	place	I	can	be	without	people	tripping	over	me.”

“No	good,”	Lewis	said,	shaking	her	head.	“If	one	seal	breaks,	you	die.”

“I	can't	think	of	anywhere	else	to	sleep,”	he	said.	“The	ship	is	pretty	cramped,
and	if	I	sleep	in	a	halway	I'l	be	in	people's	way.”

“Ok,	from	now	on,	sleep	in	Beck's	room.	Beck	can	sleep	with	Johanssen.”

Johanssen	blushed	and	looked	down	awkwardly.

“So...”	Beck	said,	“You	know	about	that?”

“You	thought	I	didn't?”	Lewis	said.	“It's	a	smal	ship.”

“You're	not	mad?”

“If	it	were	a	normal	mission,	I	would	be,”	Lewis	said.	“But	we're	way	off-script
now.	Just	keep	it	from	interfering	with	your	duties	and	I'm	happy.”

“Milion-mile-high	club,”	Martinez	said.	“Nice!”

Johanssen	blushed	deeper	and	buried	her	face	in	her	hands.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	444

I'm	getting	pretty	good	at	this.	Maybe	when	al	this	is	over	I	could	be	a	product-
tester	for	Mars	rovers.

Things	went	wel.	I	spent	five	sols	driving	in	circles;	I	averaged	93	km	per	sol.
That's	a	little	better	than	I'd	expected.	The	terrain	here	is	flat	and	smooth,	so	it's
pretty	much	a	best-case	scenario.	Once	I'm	going	up	hils	and	around	boulders	it
won't	be	nearly	that	good.

The	bedroom	is	awesome.	Large,	spacious,	and	comfortable.	On	the	first	night,	I
ran	in	to	a	little	problem	with	the	temperature.	It	was

fucking	cold.	The	rover	and	trailer	regulate	their	own	temperatures	just	fine,	but
things	weren't	hot	enough	in	the	bedroom.

Story	of	my	life.

The	rover	has	an	electric	heater	that	pushes	air	with	a	smal	fan.	I	don't	use	it	for
anything	because	the	RTG	provides	al	the	heat	I	need.

I	liberated	the	fan	and	wired	it	in	to	a	power	line	near	the	airlock.	Once	it	had
power	al	I	had	to	do	was	point	it	at	the	bedroom.

It's	a	low-tech	solution,	but	it	worked.	There's	plenty	of	heat,	thanks	to	the	RTG.
I	just	needed	to	get	it	evenly	spread	out.	For	once,	entropy	was	on	my	side.

I	fel	in	to	a	routine	pretty	quickly.	In	fact,	it	was	hauntingly	familiar.	I	did	it	for
22	miserable	days	on	the	Pathfinder	trip.	But	this	time,	I	had	the	bedroom	and
that	makes	al	the	difference.	Instead	of	being	cooped	up	in	the	rover,	I	have	my
own	little	Hab.

The	procedure	is	what	you'd	expect.	After	waking	up,	I	have	a	potato	for
breakfast.	Then,	I	deflate	the	bedroom	from	the	inside.	It's

kind	of	tricky,	but	I	worked	out	how.

First,	I	put	on	an	EVA	suit.	Then	I	close	the	inner	airlock	door,	leaving	the	outer
door	(which	the	bedroom	is	attached	to)	open.	This

isolates	the	bedroom,	with	me	in	it,	from	the	rest	of	the	rover.	Then	I	tel	the
airlock	to	depressurize.	It	thinks	it's	just	pumping	the	air	out	of	a	smal	area,	but
it's	actualy	deflating	the	whole	bedroom.

Once	the	pressure	is	gone,	I	pul	the	canvas	in	and	fold	it.	Then	I	detach	it	from
the	outer	hatch	and	close	the	outer	door.	This	is	the

most	cramped	part.	I	have	to	share	the	airlock	with	the	entire	folded	up	bedroom
while	it	repressurizes.	Once	I	have	pressure	again,	I	open	the	inner	door	and
more-or-less	fal	in	to	the	rover.	Then	I	stow	the	bedroom,	and	go	back	to	the
airlock	for	a	normal	egress	to	Mars.

It's	a	complicated	process,	but	it	detaches	the	bedroom	without	having	to
depressurize	the	rover	cabin.	Remember,	the	rover	has	al	my

stuff	that	doesn't	play	wel	with	vacuum.

The	next	step	is	to	gather	up	the	solar	cels	I'd	laid	out	the	day	before	and	stow
them	on	the	rover	and	trailer.	Then	I	do	a	quick	check	on	the	trailer.	I	go	in
through	its	airlock	and	basicaly	take	a	quick	look	at	al	the	equipment.	I	don't
even	take	off	my	EVA	suit.	I	just	want	to	make	sure	nothing's	obviously	wrong.

Then,	back	to	the	rover.	Once	inside,	I	take	off	the	EVA	suit	and	start	driving.	I
drive	for	almost	4	hours,	and	then	I'm	out	of	power.

Once	I	park,	it's	back	in	to	the	EVA	suit	for	me,	and	out	to	Mars	again.	I	lay	the
solar	panels	out	and	get	the	batteries	charging.

Then	I	set	up	the	bedroom.	Pretty	much	the	reverse	of	the	sequence	I	use	to	stow
it.	Ultimately	it's	the	airlock	that	inflates	it.	In	a	way,	the	bedroom	is	just	an
extension	of	the	airlock.

Even	though	it's	possible,	I	don't	rapid-inflate	the	bedroom.	I	did	that	to	test	it
because	I	wanted	to	find	where	it'l	leak.	But	it's	not	a	good	idea.	Rapid	inflation
puts	a	lot	of	shock	and	pressure	on	it.	It	would	eventualy	rupture.	I	didn't	enjoy
that	time	the	Hab	launched	me	like	a	cannonbal.	I'm	not	eager	to	repeat	it.

Once	the	bedroom	is	set	up	again,	I	can	take	off	my	EVA	suit	and	relax	the	rest
of	the	day.	I	mostly	watch	crappy	70's	TV.	I'm

indistinguishable	from	an	unemployed	guy	for	most	of	the	day.

I	folowed	that	process	for	four	sols,	and	then	it	was	time	for	an	“Air	Day”.

An	Air	Day	turns	out	to	be	pretty	much	the	same	as	any	other	day,	but	without
the	4	hour	drive.	Once	I	set	up	the	solar	panels,	I	fired

up	the	Oxygenator	and	let	it	work	through	the	backlog	of	CO2	the	Regulator	had
stored	up.

Once	it	was	done,	my	test	run	was	complete.	It	converted	al	the	CO2	to	oxygen,
and	used	up	the	day's	power	generation	to	do	it.

The	test	was	a	success.	I'l	be	ready	on	time.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	449

Today's	the	big	day.	I'm	leaving	for	Schiapareli.

The	rover	and	trailer	are	al	packed.	They've	been	mostly	packed	since	the	test
run.	But	now	I	even	have	the	water	aboard.

I	spent	the	last	several	days	running	ful	diagnostics	on	everything.	The
Regulator,	Oxygenator,	RTG,	AREC,	batteries,	rover	life

support	(in	case	I	need	a	backup),	solar	cels,	rover	computer,	airlocks,	and
everything	else	with	a	moving	part	or	electronic	component.	I	even	checked	each
of	the	motors.	Eight	in	al,	one	for	each	wheel,	four	on	the	rover,	four	on	the
trailer.	The	trailer's	motors	won't	be

powered,	but	it's	nice	to	have	backups.

It's	al	good	to	go.	No	problems	that	I	can	see.

The	Hab	is	a	shel	of	its	former	self.	I've	robbed	it	of	al	critical	components	and	a
big	chunk	of	its	canvas.	I've	looted	that	poor	Hab	for	everything	it	could	give
me,	and	in	return	it's	kept	me	alive	for	a	year	and	a	half.	It's	like	The	Giving
Tree.

I	performed	the	final	shutdown	today.	The	heaters,	lighting,	main	computer,	etc.
Al	the	components	I	didn't	steal	for	the	trip	to

Schiapareli.

I	could	have	left	them	on.	It's	not	like	anyone	would	care.	But	the	original
procedure	for	Sol	31	(which	was	supposed	to	be	the	last	day	of	the	surface
mission)	was	to	completely	shut	down	the	Hab	and	deflate	it.	NASA	didn't	want
a	big	tent	ful	of	combustible	oxygen	next	to	the	MAV	when	it	launched,	so	they
added	the	shutdown	process	to	the	mission.

I	guess	I	did	it	as	an	homage	to	the	mission	Ares	3	could	have	been.	A	smal
piece	of	the	Sol	31	I	never	got	to	have.

Once	I	shut	everything	down,	an	eerie	silence	was	al	that	remained.	I've	spent
449	sols	listening	to	the	heaters,	vents,	and	fans.	But

now	it	was	dead	quiet.	It's	a	creepy,	eerie	kind	of	quiet	that's	hard	to	describe.
I've	been	away	from	the	Hab	before,	but	always	in	the	rover	or	an	EVA	suit.
There's	always	some	kind	of	machinery	in	operation.

But	now	there	was	nothing.	I	never	realized	how	utterly	silent	Mars	is.	It's	a
desert	world	with	practicaly	no	atmosphere	to	convey

sound.	I	could	hear	my	own	heartbeat.

Anyway,	enough	waxing	philosophical.

I'm	in	the	rover	right	now.	(That	should	be	obvious,	with	the	Hab	main	computer
offline	forever.)	I've	got	2	ful	batteries,	al	systems	are	go	and	I've	got	45	sols	of
driving	ahead	of	me.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	458

Mawrth	Valis!	I'm	finaly	here!

Actualy,	it's	not	an	impressive	accomplishment.	I've	only	been	traveling	10	sols.
But	it's	a	good	psychological	milestone.

So	far,	the	rover	and	my	ghetto	life	support	are	working	admirably.	At	least,	as
wel	as	can	be	expected	for	equipment	being	used	ten

times	longer	than	intended.

Today	is	my	second	Air	Day	(the	first	was	5	sols	ago).	When	I	put	this	scheme
together,	I	figured	Air	Days	would	be	godawful	boring.

But	now	I	look	forward	to	them.	They're	my	days	off.

On	a	normal	day	I	get	up,	fold	up	the	bedroom,	stack	the	solar	cels,	drive	four
hours,	set	up	the	solar	cels,	unfurl	the	bedroom,	check

al	my	equipment	(especialy	the	rover	chassis	and	wheels),	then	make	a	Morse
Code	status	report	for	NASA	if	I	can	find	enough	nearby

rocks.

On	an	Air	Day,	I	wake	up	and	turn	on	the	Oxygenator.	The	solar	panels	are
already	out	from	the	day	before.	Everything's	ready	to	go.

Then	I	chil	out	in	the	bedroom	or	rover.	I	have	the	whole	day	to	myself.	The
bedroom	gives	me	enough	space	that	I	don't	feel	cooped	up,

and	the	computer	has	plenty	of	shitty	TV	reruns	for	me	to	enjoy.

Technicaly,	I	entered	Mawrth	Valis	yesterday.	But	I	only	knew	that	by	looking	at
a	map.	The	entrance	to	the	valey	is	wide	enough

that	I	couldn't	see	the	canyon	wals	in	either	direction.

But	now	I'm	definitely	in	a	canyon.	And	the	bottom	is	nice	and	flat.	Exactly
what	I	was	hoping	for.	It's	amazing;	this	valey	wasn't	made	by	a	river	slowly
carving	it	away.	It	was	made	by	a	mega-flood	in	a	single	day.	It	would	have	been
a	hel	of	a	thing	to	see.

Weird	thought:	I'm	not	in	Acidalia	Planitia	any	more.	I	spent	457	sols	there,
almost	a	year	and	a	half,	and	I'l	never	go	back.	I	wonder	if	I'l	be	nostalgic	about
that	later	in	life.

If	there	is	a	“later	in	life,”	I'l	be	happy	to	endure	a	little	nostalgia	in	return.	But
for	now	I	just	want	to	go	home.

“Welcome	back	to	CNN's	Mark	Watney	Report,”	Cathy	said	to	the	camera.
“We're	speaking	with	our	frequent	guest,	Dr.	Venkat

Kapoor.	Dr.	Kapoor,	I	guess	what	people	want	to	know	is:	Is	Mark	Watney
doomed?”

“We	hope	not,”	Venkat	responded.	“But	he's	got	a	real	chalenge	ahead	of	him.”

“According	to	your	latest	satelite	data,	the	dust	storm	in	Arabia	Terra	isn't
abating	at	al,	and	wil	block	80%	of	the	sunlight?”

“That's	correct.”

“And	can	Watney's	only	source	of	energy	is	his	solar	panels,	correct?”

“Yes,	that's	right.”

“Can	his	makeshift	rover	operate	at	20%	power?”

“We	haven't	found	any	way	to	make	that	happen,	no.	His	life	support	alone	takes
more	energy	than	that.”

“How	long	until	he	enters	the	Tau	Event.”

“He's	just	entered	Mawrth	Valis	now.	At	his	current	rate	of	travel,	he'l	be	at	the
edge	of	the	Tau	Event	on	Sol	471.	That's	12	days

from	now.”

“Surely	he'l	see	something	is	wrong,”	Cathy	said.	“With	such	low	visibility,	it
won't	take	long	for	him	to	realize	his	solar	cels	wil	have	a	problem.	Couldn't	he
just	turn	around	at	that	point?”

“Unfortunately,	everything's	working	against	him,”	Venkat	said.	“The	edge	of
the	storm	isn't	a	magic	line.	It's	just	an	area	where	the	dust	gets	a	little	more
dense.	It'l	keep	getting	more	and	more	dense	as	he	travels	onward.	It'l	be	realy
subtle;	every	day	wil	be	slightly	darker	than	the	last.	Too	subtle	to	notice.”

Venkat	sighed.	“He'l	go	hundreds	of	kilometers,	wondering	why	his	solar	panel
efficiency	is	going	down,	before	he's	notices	any

visibility	problems.	And	the	storm	is	moving	west	as	he	moves	east.	He'l	be	too
deep	in	to	get	out.”

“Are	we	just	watching	a	tragedy	play	out?”	Cathy	asked.

“There's	always	hope,”	Venkat	said.	“Maybe	he'l	figure	it	out	faster	than	we
think	and	turn	around	in	time.	Maybe	the	storm	wil

dissipate	unexpectedly.	Maybe	he'l	find	a	way	to	keep	his	life	support	going	on
less	energy	than	we	thought	was	possible.	Mark	Watney	is	now	an	expert	at
surviving	on	Mars.	If	anyone	can	do	it,	it's	him.”

“Twelve	days,”	Cathy	said	to	the	camera.	“Al	of	Earth	is	watching,	but
powerless	to	help.”

Another	uneventful	sol.	Tomorrow	is	an	Air	Day,	so	this	is	kind	of	my	Friday
night.

I'm	about	half-way	through	Mawrth	Valis	now.	Just	as	I'd	hoped,	the	going	has
been	easy.	No	major	elevation	changes.	Hardly	any

obstacles.	Just	smooth	sand	with	rocks	smaler	than	half	a	meter.

You	may	be	wondering	how	I	navigate.	When	I	went	to	Pathfinder,	I	watched

Phobos	transit	the	sky	to	figure	out	the	east-west	axis.

But	Pathfinder	was	an	easy	trip	compared	to	this,	and	I	did	it	mostly	with
landmarks.

I	can't	get	away	with	that	this	time.	My	“map”	(such	as	it	is)	consists	of	satelite
images	far	too	low-resolution	to	be	of	any	use.	They	just	never	expected	me	to
be	out	this	far.	The	only	reason	I	had	high-res	images	of	the	Pathfinder	region	is
because	they	were	included	for	landing	purposes;	in	case	Martinez	had	to	land
way	long	of	our	target.

So	this	time	around,	I	needed	a	reliable	way	to	fix	my	position	on	Mars.

Latitude	and	Longitude.	That's	the	key.	The	first	is	easy.	Ancient	sailors	on	Earth
figured	that	one	out	right	away.	Earth's	23.5	degree	axis	points	at	Polaris.	Mars
has	a	tilt	of	just	over	25	degrees,	so	it's	pointed	at	Deneb.

Making	a	sextant	isn't	hard.	Al	you	need	is	a	tube	to	look	through,	a	string,	a
weight,	and	something	with	degree	markings.	I	made	it	in	under	an	hour.

So	I	go	out	every	night	with	a	home-made	sextant	and	sight	Deneb.	It's	kind	of
sily	if	you	think	about	it.	I'm	in	my	space	suit	on	Mars

and	I'm	navigating	with	16th	century	tools.	But	hey,	they	work.

Longitude	is	a	different	matter.	On	Earth,	the	earliest	way	to	work	out	longitude
required	them	to	know	the	exact	time,	then	compare	it

to	the	sun's	position	in	the	sky.	The	hard	part	for	them	back	then	was	inventing	a
clock	that	would	work	on	a	boat	(pendulums	don't	work	on	boats).	Al	the	top
scientific	minds	of	the	age	worked	on	the	problem.

Fortunately,	I	have	accurate	clocks.	There	are	four	computers	in	my	immediate
line	of	sight	right	now.	And	I	have	Phobos.

Because	Phobos	is	ridiculously	close	to	Mars,	it	orbits	the	planet	in	less	than	one
Martian	day.	So	it	travels	west	to	east	(unlike	the	sun	and	Deimos)	and	sets	every
11	hours.	And	naturaly,	it	moves	in	a	very	predictable	pattern.

I	spend	13	hours	every	sol	just	sitting	around	while	the	solar	panels	charge	the

batteries.	Phobos	is	guaranteed	to	set	at	least	once

during	that	time.	I	note	the	time	when	it	does.	Then	I	plug	it	in	to	a	nasty	formula
I	worked	out	and	I	know	my	longitude.

So,	working	out	longitude	requires	Phobos	to	set,	and	working	out	latitude
requires	it	to	be	night	so	I	can	sight	Deneb.	It's	not	a	very	fast	system.	But	I	only
need	it	once	a	day.	I	work	out	my	location	when	I'm	parked,	and	account	for	it	in
the	next	day's	travel.	It's	kind	of	a	successive	approximation	thing.	So	far,	it's
been	working.

Mindy	Park	zoomed	in	on	the	latest	satelite	photo	with	practiced	ease.	Watney's
encampment	was	visible	in	the	center,	the	solar	cels

laid	out	in	a	circular	pattern	as	was	his	habit.

The	bedroom	was	inflated.	Checking	the	timestamp	on	the	image,	it	was	from
noon	local	time.	She	quickly	found	the	status	report;

Watney	always	placed	it	close	to	the	rover	when	rocks	were	in	abundance,
usualy	to	the	north.

To	save	time,	Mindy	had	taught	herself	Morse	Code	so	she	wouldn't	have	to	look
each	letter	up	every	morning.	Opening	an	email,	she

addressed	it	to	the	ever-growing	list	of	people	who	wanted	Watney's	daily	status
message.

“ON	TRACK	FOR	SOL	495	ARRIVAL.”

She	frowned	and	added	“Note:	5	sols	until	Tau	Event	entry.”

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	466

Mawrth	Valis	was	fun	while	it	lasted.	I'm	in	Arabia	Terra	now.

I	just	entered	the	edge	of	it,	if	my	latitude	and	longitude	calculations	are	correct.
But	even	without	the	math,	it's	pretty	obvious	the	terrain	is	changing.

For	the	last	two	sols,	I've	spent	almost	al	my	time	on	an	incline,	working	my	way

up	the	back	wal	of	Mawrth	Valis.	It	was	a	gentle

rise,	but	a	constant	one.	I'm	at	a	much	higher	altitude	now.	Adicalia	Planitia
(where	the	lonely	Hab	is	hanging	out)	is	3000m	below	elevation	zero,	and
Arabia	Terra	is	500m	below.	So	I've	gone	up	two	and	a	half	kilometers.

Want	to	know	what's	at	elevation	zero?	On	Earth,	it's	sea	level.	Obviously,	that
won't	work	on	Mars.	So	lab-coated	geeks	got	together

and	decided	Mars's	elevation	zero	is	wherever	the	air	pressure	is	610.5	Pascals.
That's	about	500	meters	up	from	where	I	am	right	now.

Now	things	get	tricky.	In	Acidalia	Planitia,	if	I	got	off-course,	I	could	just	point
in	the	right	direction	based	on	new	data.	Later,	in	Mawrth	Valis,	it	was
impossible	to	fuck	it	up.	I	just	had	to	folow	the	canyon.

Now	I'm	in	a	rougher	neighborhood.	The	kind	of	neighborhood	where	you	keep
your	rover	doors	locked,	and	never	come	to	a

complete	stop	at	intersections.	Wel,	not	realy,	but	it's	bad	to	get	off-course	here.

Arabia	Terra	has	large,	brutal	craters	that	I	have	to	drive	around.	If	I	navigate
poorly,	I'l	end	up	at	the	edge	of	one.	I	can't	just	drive	down	one	side	and	up	the
other.	Rising	in	elevation	costs	a	ton	of	energy.	On	flat	ground,	I	can	make	90km
per	day.	On	a	steep	slope,	I'd	be	lucky	to	get	40km.	Plus,	driving	on	a	slope	is
dangerous.	One	mistake	and	I	could	rol	the	rover.	I	don't	even	want	to	think
about	that.

Yes,	I'l	eventualy	have	to	drive	down	in	to	Schiapareli.	No	way	around	that.	I'l
have	to	be	realy	careful.

Anyway,	if	I	end	up	at	the	edge	of	a	crater	I'l	have	to	backtrack	to	somewhere
useful.	And	it's	a	damn	maze	of	craters	out	here.	I'l

have	to	be	on	my	guard;	observant	at	al	times.	I'l	need	to	navigate	with
landmarks	as	wel	as	latitude	and	longitude.

My	first	chalenge	is	to	pass	between	the	craters	Rutherford	and	Trouvelot.	It
shouldn't	be	too	hard.	They're	100km	apart.	Even	I	can't

fuck	that	up,	right?

Right?

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	468

I	managed	to	thread	the	needle	between	Rutherford	and	Trouvelot	nicely.
Admittedly,	the	needle	was	a	100km	wide,	but	hey.

I'm	now	enjoying	my	fourth	Air	Day	of	the	trip.	I've	been	on	the	road	for	20	sols.
So	far,	I'm	right	on	schedule.	According	to	my	maps,

I've	traveled	1,440km.	Not	quite	halfway	there,	but	almost.

I've	been	gathering	soil	and	rock	samples	from	each	place	I	camp.	I	did	the	same
thing	on	my	way	to	Pathfinder.	But	this	time,	I	know

NASA's	watching	me.	So	I'm	labeling	each	sample	by	the	current	sol.	They'l
know	my	location	a	hel	of	a	lot	more	accurately	than	I	do.

They	can	correlate	the	samples	with	their	locations	later.

It	might	be	a	wasted	effort.	The	MAV	isn't	going	to	have	much	weight	alowance
when	I	launch.	To	intercept	Hermes,	it'l	have	to	reach

escape	velocity,	but	it	was	only	designed	to	get	to	orbit.	The	only	way	to	get	it
going	fast	enough	is	to	lose	a	lot	of	weight.

At	least	that	jury-rigging	wil	be	NASA's	job	to	work	out,	not	mine.	Once	I	get	to
the	MAV,	I'l	be	back	in	contact	with	them	and	they

can	tel	me	what	modifications	to	make.

They'l	probably	say	“Thanks	for	gathering	samples.	But	leave	them	behind.	And
one	of	your	arms,	too.	Whichever	one	you	like	least.”

But	on	the	off-chance	I	can	bring	them,	I'm	gathering	them.

The	next	few	days	travel	should	be	easy.	The	next	major	obstacle	is	Marth
Crater.	It's	right	in	my	straight-line	path	toward	Schiapareli.

It'l	cost	me	a	hundred	kilometers	or	so	to	go	around,	but	it	can't	be	helped.	I'l	try
to	aim	for	the	southern	edge.	The	closer	I	get	to	the	rim	the	less	time	I	waste
going	around	it.

“Did	you	read	today's	updates?”	Lewis	asked,	puling	her	meal	from	the
microwave.

“Yeah,”	Martinez	said,	sipping	his	drink.

She	sat	across	the	Rec	table	from	him.	Carefuly	opening	the	steaming	package,
she	let	it	cool	for	a	moment	before	eating.	“Mark

entered	the	dust	storm	yesterday.”

“Yeah,	I	saw	that,”	he	said.

“We	need	to	face	the	possibility	that	he	won't	make	it	to	Schiapareli,”	Lewis
said.	“If	that	happens,	we	need	to	keep	morale	up.	We

stil	have	a	long	way	to	go	before	we	get	home.”

“He	was	dead	before,”	Martinez	said.	“It	was	rough	on	morale,	but	we	soldiered
on.	Besides,	he	won't	die.”

“It's	pretty	bleak,	Rick,”	Lewis	said.	“He's	already	50km	in	to	the	storm,	and	he'l
go	another	90km	per	sol.	He'l	get	in	too	deep	to

recover	soon.”

Martinez	shook	his	head.	“He'l	pul	through,	Commander.	Have	faith.”

She	smiled	forlornly.	“Rick,	you	know	I'm	not	religious.”

“I	know,”	he	said.	“I'm	not	talking	about	faith	in	God,	I'm	talking	about	faith	in
Mark	Watney.	Look	at	al	the	shit	Mars	has	thrown	at

him,	and	he's	stil	alive.	He'l	survive	this.	I	don't	know	how,	but	he	wil.	He's	a
clever	son-of-a-bitch.”

Lewis	took	a	bite	of	her	food.	“I	hope	you're	right.”

“Want	to	bet	$100?”	Martinez	said	with	a	smile.

“Of	course	not,”	Lewis	said.

“Damn	right,”	he	smiled.

“I'd	never	bet	on	a	crewmate	dying,”	Lewis	said.	“But	that	doesn't	mean	I	think
he'l-”

“Blah	blah	blah,”	Martinez	interrupted.	“Deep	down,	you	think	he'l	make	it.”

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	473

My	fifth	Air	Day,	and	things	are	going	wel.	I	should	be	skimming	south	of
Marth	Crater	tomorrow.	It'l	get	easier	after	that.

I'm	in	the	middle	of	a	bunch	of	craters	that	form	a	triangle.	I'm	caling	it	the
Watney	Triangle	because	after	what	I've	been	through,	shit	on	Mars	should	be
named	after	me.

Trouvelot,	Becquerel,	and	Marth	form	the	points	of	the	triangle,	with	5	other
major	craters	along	the	sides.	Normaly	this	wouldn't	be	a

problem	at	al,	but	with	my	extremely	rough	navigation,	I	could	easily	end	up	at
the	lip	of	one	of	them	and	have	to	backtrack.

After	Marth,	I'l	be	out	of	the	Watney	Triangle	(yeah,	I'm	liking	that	name	more
and	more).	Then	I	can	beeline	toward	Schiapareli	with

impunity.	There'l	stil	be	plenty	of	craters	in	the	way,	but	they're	comparatively
smal	and	going	around	them	won't	cost	much	time.

Progress	has	been	great.	Arabia	Terra	is	certainly	rockier	than	Acidalia	Planitia,
but	nowhere	near	as	bad	as	I'd	feared.	I've	been	able	to	drive	over	most	of	the
rocks,	and	around	the	ones	that	are	too	big.

I	have	1435km	left	to	go.	Ares	4's	MAV	is	in	the	southwest	part	of	Schiapareli.
The	primary	goal	of	Ares	4	is	to	get	a	look	at	the

long-term	effects	of	Martian	weather	on	deep	layers	of	strata	exposed	by	the

crater.

At	least,	that	was	the	original	plan.	I'l	be	taking	their	MAV	and	Commander
Lewis	hasn't	given	Hermes	back,	so	we've	ruined

everything.	They'l	probably	just	send	another	MAV	and	wait	for	the	next
window.

I	did	some	research	on	Schiapareli	and	found	some	good	news.	The	best	way	in
is	right	in	my	direct-line	path.	I	won't	have	to	drive	the

perimeter	at	al.	And	the	way	in	is	easy	to	find,	even	when	you	suck	at
navigating.	The	northwest	rim	has	a	smaler	crater	on	it,	and	that's	the	landmark
I'l	be	looking	for.	To	the	southwest	of	that	little	crater	is	a	gentle	slope	in	to
Schiapareli	Basin.

The	little	crater	doesn't	have	a	name.	At	least,	not	on	the	maps	I	have.	So	I	dub	it
“Entrance	Crater.”	Because	I	can.

In	other	news,	my	equipment	is	starting	to	show	signs	of	age.	Not	surprising,
considering	it's	way	the	hel	past	its	expiration	date.	For	the	past	two	sols,	the
batteries	have	taken	longer	to	recharge.	The	solar	cels	just	aren't	producing	as
much	wattage	as	before.	It's	not	a	big	deal,	I	just	need	to	charge	a	little	longer.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	474

Wel,	I	fucked	it	up.

It	was	bound	to	happen	eventualy.	I	navigated	badly	and	ended	up	at	the	ridge	of
Marth	Crater.	With	it	being	100km	wide,	I	can't	see

the	whole	thing,	so	I	don't	know	where	on	the	circle	I	am.

The	ridge	runs	perpendicular	to	the	direction	I	was	going.	So	I	have	no	clue
which	way	I	should	go.	And	I	don't	want	to	take	the	long

way	around	if	I	can	avoid	it.	Originaly	I	wanted	to	go	around	to	the	south,	but
north	is	just	as	likely	to	be	the	best	path	now	that	I'm	off-course.

I'l	have	to	wait	for	another	Phobos	transit	to	get	my	longitude,	and	I'l	need	to

wait	for	nightfal	to	sight	Deneb	for	my	latitude.	So	I'm	done	driving	for	the	day.
I'd	made	70km	out	of	the	90km	I	usualy	do.	So	it's	not	too	much	wasted	potential
driving.

Marth	isn't	too	steep.	I	could	probably	just	drive	down	one	side	and	up	the	other.
It's	big	enough	that	I'd	end	up	camping	inside	it	one	night.	But	I	don't	want	to
take	unnecessary	risks.	Slopes	are	bad	and	should	be	avoided.	I	gave	myself
plenty	of	buffer	time,	so	I'm	going	to	play	it	safe.

I'm	ending	today's	drive	early	and	setting	up	for	recharge.	Probably	a	good	idea
anyway	with	the	solar	cels	acting	up;	it'l	give	them

more	time	to	work.	They	underperformed	again	last	night.	I	checked	al	the
connections	and	made	sure	there	wasn't	any	dust	on	them,	but

they	stil	just	aren't	100%.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	475

I'm	in	trouble.

I	watched	two	Phobos	transits	yesterday	and	sighted	Deneb	last	night.	I	worked
out	my	location	as	accurately	as	I	could,	and	it	wasn't

what	I	wanted	to	see.	As	far	as	I	can	tel,	I	hit	Marth	Crater	dead-on.

Craaaaap.

This	is	the	worst	case	scenario.	I	can	go	north	or	south,	and	they'l	be	about	the
same.	It'l	cost	at	least	a	day	to	correct.	Al	because	I	aimed	wrong	yesterday.

That's	frustrating,	but	it's	not	why	I'm	in	trouble.

I	stil	wanted	to	be	efficient,	and	I	wasn't	100%	sure	where	I	was.	So	I	took	a
little	walk	this	morning.	It	was	over	a	kilometer	to	the

peak	of	the	rim.	That's	the	sort	of	walk	people	do	on	Earth	without	thinking
twice,	but	in	an	EVA	suit	it's	an	ordeal.

I	can't	wait	til	I	have	grandchildren.	“When	I	was	younger,	I	had	to	walk	to	the

rim	of	a	crater.	Uphil!	In	an	EVA	suit!	On	Mars,	ya

little	shit!	Ya	hear	me?	Mars!”

Anyway,	I	got	up	to	the	rim	and	damn,	it's	a	beautiful	sight.	From	my	high
vantage	point,	I	got	a	stunning	panorama.	I	figured	I	might	be	able	to	see	the	far
side	of	Marth	Crater,	and	maybe	work	out	if	north	or	south	was	the	best	way
around	it.

But	I	couldn't	see	the	far	side.	There	was	a	haze	in	the	air.	It's	not	uncommon;
Mars	has	weather	and	wind	and	dust,	after	al.	But	it

seemed	hazier	than	it	should.	I'm	accustomed	to	the	wide-open	expanses	of
Acidalia	Planitia,	my	former	prairie	home.

Then	it	got	weirder.	I	turned	around	and	looked	back	toward	the	rover	and	trailer.
Everything	was	where	I'd	left	it	(very	few	car	thieves	on	Mars).	But	the	view
seemed	a	lot	clearer.

I	looked	east	across	Marth	again.	Then	west	to	the	horizon.	Then	east,	then	west.
Each	turn	required	me	to	rotate	my	whole	body,

EVA	suits	being	what	they	are.

Yesterday,	I	passed	a	crater.	It's	about	50km	west	of	here.	It's	just	visible	on	the
horizon.	But	looking	east,	I	can't	see	anywhere	near	that	far.	Marth	Crater	is
110km	wide.	With	a	visibility	of	50km,	I	should	at	least	be	able	to	see	a	distinct
curvature	of	the	rim.	But	I	can't.

The	fuck?

At	first,	I	didn't	know	what	to	make	of	it.	But	the	lack	of	symmetry	bothered	me.
And	I've	learned	to	be	suspicious	of	everything.

That's	when	a	bunch	of	stuff	started	to	dawn	on	me:

1)	The	only	explanation	for	asymmetrical	visibility	is	a	dust	storm.

2)	Dust	storms	reduce	the	effectiveness	of	solar	cels.

3)	My	solar	cels	have	been	slowly	losing	effectiveness	for	several	sols.

From	this,	I	concluded	the	folowing:

1)	I've	been	in	a	dust	storm	for	several	sols.

2)	Shit.

Not	only	am	I	in	a	dust	storm,	but	it	gets	thicker	as	I	approach	Schiapareli.	A	few
hours	ago,	I	was	worried	because	I	had	to	go

around	Marth	Crater.	Now	I'm	going	to	have	to	go	around	something	a	fuckload
bigger.

And	I	have	to	hustle.	Dust	storms	move.	Sitting	stil	means	I'l	likely	get
overwhelmed.	But	which	way	do	I	go?	It's	no	longer	an	issue	of	trying	to	be
efficient.	If	I	go	the	wrong	way	this	time,	I'l	eat	dust	and	die.

I	don't	have	satelite	imagery.	I	have	no	way	of	knowing	the	size	or	shape	of	the
storm,	or	its	heading.	Man,	I'd	give	anything	for	a	5-

minute	conversation	with	NASA.	Now	that	I	think	of	it,	NASA	must	be	shitting
bricks	watching	this	play	out.

I'm	on	the	clock.	I	have	to	figure	out	how	to	figure	out	what	I	need	to	know
about	the	storm.	And	I	have	to	do	it	now.

And	right	this	second	nothing	comes	to	mind.

Mindy	trudged	to	her	computer.	Today's	shift	began	at	2:10pm.	Her	schedule
matched	Watney's	every	day.	She	slept	when	he	slept.

Watney	simply	slept	at	night	on	Mars,	while	Mindy	had	to	drift	40	minutes
forward	every	day,	taping	aluminum	foil	to	her	windows	to	get

any	sleep	at	al.

She	brought	up	the	most	recent	satelite	images.	She	cocked	an	eyebrow.	He	had

midday	sun	to	maximize	recharging.

But	today,	he	had	not	moved,	and	it	was	wel	past	morning.

She	checked	around	the	rovers	and	bedroom	for	a	message.	She	found	it	in	the

I	think	I	can	work	this	out.

I'm	on	the	very	edge	of	a	storm.	I	don't	know	its	size	or	heading.	But	it's	moving,
and	that's	something	I	can	take	advantage	of.	I	don't	have	to	wander	around
exploring	it.	It'l	come	to	me.

The	storm	is	just	dust	in	the	air;	it's	not	dangerous	to	the	rovers.	I	can	think	of	it
as	“Percent	power	loss.”	I	checked	yesterdays	power	generation	and	it	was	97%
of	optimal.	So	right	now,	it's	a	3%	storm.

I	need	to	make	progress	and	I	need	to	regenerate	oxygen.	Those	are	my	two
main	goals.	I	use	20%	of	my	overal	power	to	reclaim

oxygen	(when	I	stop	for	Air	Days).	If	I	end	up	in	an	81%	part	of	the	storm,	I'l	be
in	real	trouble.	I'l	run	out	of	oxygen	even	if	I	dedicate	al	available	power	to	it.
That's	the	fatal	scenario.	But	realy,	it's	fatal	much	earlier	than	that.	I	need	power
to	move	or	I'l	be	stranded	until	the	storm	passes	or	dissipates.	That	could	be
months.

The	more	power	I	generate,	the	more	I'l	have	for	movement.	With	clear	skies,	I
dedicate	80%	of	my	total	power	toward	movement.	I

get	90km	per	sol	this	way.	So	Right	now,	at	3%	loss,	I'm	getting	3.3km	less	than
I	should.

It's	ok	to	lose	some	driving	distance	per	sol.	I	have	plenty	of	time,	but	I	can't	let
myself	get	too	deep	in	the	storm	or	I'l	never	be	able	to	get	out.

At	the	very	least,	I	need	to	travel	faster	than	the	storm.	If	I	can	go	faster,	I	can
maneuver	around	it	without	being	enveloped.	I	need	to	find	out	how	fast	it's
moving.

I	can	do	that	by	sitting	here	for	a	sol.	I	can	compare	tomorrow's	wattage	to
today's.	Al	I	have	to	do	is	make	sure	to	compare	the	same

times	of	day.	Then	I'd	know	how	fast	the	storm	is	moving,	at	least	in	terms	of
percent	power	loss.

But	I	need	to	know	the	shape	of	the	storm,	too.

Dust	storms	are	big.	They	can	be	thousands	of	kilometers	across.	So	when	I
work	my	way	around	it,	I'l	need	to	know	which	way	to

go.	I'l	want	to	move	perpendicular	to	the	storm's	movement,	and	in	whatever
direction	has	less	storm.

So	here's	my	plan:

Right	now,	I	can	go	86km	(because	I	couldn't	get	a	ful	battery	yesterday).	I'm
going	to	leave	a	solar	cel	here	and	drive	40km	due

south.	Then	I'l	drop	off	another	solar	cel	and	drive	another	40km	due	south.	I'l
have	three	points	of	reference	across	80km.

The	next	day,	I'l	go	back	to	colect	the	cels	and	get	the	data.	By	comparing	the
wattage	at	the	same	time	of	day	in	those	three

locations,	I'l	learn	the	shape	of	the	storm.	If	the	storm	is	thicker	to	the	south,	I'l
go	north	to	get	around	it.	If	it's	thicker	north,	I'l	go	south.

I'm	hoping	to	go	south.	Schiapareli	is	southeast	of	me.	Going	north	would	add	a
lot	of	time	to	my	total	trip.

There's	one	slight	problem	with	my	plan:	I	don't	have	any	way	to	“record”	the
wattage	from	an	abandoned	solar	cel.	I	can	easily	track	and	log	wattage	with	the
rover	computer,	but	I	need	something	I	can	drop	off	and	leave	behind.	I	can't	just
take	readings	as	I	drive	along.	I	need	readings	at	the	same	time	in	different
places.

So	I'm	going	to	spend	today	working	on	some	mad	science.	I	have	to	make
something	that	can	log	wattage.	Something	I	can	leave

behind	with	a	single	solar	cel.

Since	I'm	stuck	here	for	the	day	anyway,	I'l	leave	the	solar	cels	out.	I	may	as	wel

get	a	ful	battery	out	of	it.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	477

It	took	al	day	yesterday	and	today,	but	I	think	I'm	ready	to	measure	this	storm.

When	I	packed	for	this	road	trip,	I	made	sure	to	bring	al	my	kits	and	tools.	Just
in	case	I	had	to	repair	the	rover	en-route.

I	made	the	bedroom	in	to	a	lab.	I	stacked	my	supply	containers	to	form	a
rudimentary	table,	and	used	a	sample	box	as	a	stool.

I	needed	a	way	to	track	the	time	of	day	and	the	wattage	of	the	solar	cel.	The
tricky	part	is	logging	it.	And	the	solution	is	the	extra	EVA	suit	I	brought	along.

The	cool	thing	about	EVA	suits	is	they	have	cameras	recording	everything	they
see.	There's	a	camera	on	the	right	arm	(or	the	left	if	the	astronaut	is	left	handed),
and	one	above	the	faceplate.	A	time-stamp	is	burned	in	to	the	lower	left	corner	of
the	image,	just	like	the	shaky	home	videos	Dad	used	to	take.

My	electronics	kit	has	several	power	meters.	So	I	figure:	why	make	my	own
logging	system?	I	can	just	film	the	power	meter	al	day

long.

So	that's	what	I	set	up.

First,	I	harvested	the	cameras	from	my	spare	EVA	suit.	I	had	to	be	careful;	I
didn't	want	to	ruin	the	suit.	It's	my	only	spare.	I	had	to	get	the	cameras	and	the
lines	leading	to	their	memory	chips.

I	put	a	power	meter	in	to	a	smal	sample	container,	then	glued	a	camera	to	the
underside	of	the	lid.	When	I	sealed	up	the	container,	the

camera	was	properly	recording	the	readout	of	the	power	meter.

For	testing,	I	used	rover	power.	How	wil	it	get	power	once	I	abandon	it	on	the
surface?	Wel,	it	turns	out	it's	going	to	be	attached	to	a	2	square	meter	solar	cel.
That'l	be	plenty.	And	I	put	a	smal	rechargeable	battery	in	the	container	to	tide	it
over	during	nighttime	(again,	harvested	from	the	spare	EVA	suit).

The	next	problem	is	heat,	or	the	lack	thereof.	As	soon	as	I	take	this	thing	out	of
the	rover,	it'l	start	cooling	down	mighty	fast.	Once	it	gets	too	cold,	the
electronics	wil	stop	working	entirely.

So	I	needed	a	heat	source.	And	my	electronics	kit	provided	the	answer.
Resistors.	Lots	and	lots	of	them.	The	camera	and	power	meter

only	need	a	tiny	fraction	of	what	a	solar	cel	can	make.	So	I'm	dumping	the	rest
of	the	energy	through	resistors.

Resistors	heat	up.	It's	what	they	do.	There's	my	heat	source.

I	made	and	tested	two	“power	loggers”,	and	confirmed	the	images	were	being
properly	recorded.

Then	I	had	an	EVA.	I	detached	two	of	my	solar	cels	and	hooked	them	up	to	the
power	loggers.	I	let	them	log	happily	for	an	hour,	then

brought	them	back	in	to	check	the	results.	They	worked	great.

It's	getting	toward	nightfal	now.	Tomorrow	morning,	I'l	leave	one	power	logger
behind,	and	head	south.

While	I	was	working,	I	left	the	Oxygenator	going	(why	not?).	So	I'm	al	stocked
up	on	O2	and	good	to	go.

The	solar	cel	efficiency	for	today	was	92.5%.	Compared	to	yesterday's	97%.	So
right	now,	the	storm	is	moving	at	4.5%	per	sol.	If	I

were	to	stay	here	another	16	sols,	it	would	get	dark	enough	to	kil	me.

Just	as	wel	I'm	not	going	to	stay	here.

Everything	went	as	planned	today.	No	hiccups.	I	can't	tel	if	I'm	driving	deeper	in
to	the	storm	or	out	of	it.	It's	hard	to	tel	if	the	ambient	light	is	less	or	more	than	it
was	yesterday.	The	human	brain	works	hard	to	abstract	that	out.

I	left	a	power-logger	behind	when	I	started	out.	Then,	after	40km	travel	due

south,	I	had	a	quick	EVA	to	set	up	another.	Now	I've

gone	the	ful	80km,	set	up	my	solar	cels	for	charging,	and	I'm	logging	the
wattage.

Tomorrow,	I'l	have	to	reverse	course	and	pick	up	the	power-loggers.	It	may	be
dangerous;	I'l	be	driving	right	back	in	to	a	known

storm	area.	But	the	risk	is	worth	the	gain.

Also,	have	I	mentioned	I'm	sick	of	potatoes?	Because,	by	God,	I	am	sick	of
potatoes.	If	I	ever	return	to	Earth,	I'm	going	to	buy	a	nice

little	home	in	Western	Australia.	Because	Western	Australia	is	on	the	opposite
side	of	Earth	from	Idaho.

I	bring	it	up	because	I	dined	on	a	meal	pack	today.	I	had	saved	5	packs	for
special	occasions.	I	ate	the	first	of	them	29	sols	ago	when	I	left	for	Schiapareli.	I
totaly	forgot	to	eat	the	second	when	I	reached	the	half-way	point	9	sols	ago.	So
I'm	enjoying	my	belated	half-way	feast.

It's	probably	more	accurate	to	eat	it	today	anyway.	Who	knows	how	long	it'l	take
me	to	go	around	this	storm.	And	if	I	end	up	stuck	in

the	storm	and	doomed	to	die,	I'm	totaly	eating	the	other	earmarked	meals.

I	felt	like	that	al	day.	I'm	now	back	where	I	started	yesterday	morning.	Yuk.

Along	the	way,	I	picked	up	the	power-logger	I'd	left	behind	at	the	half-way

I	think	I'm	getting	ahead	of	the	storm.

Having	traveled	along	Mars	Highway	1	al	day,	I'm	back	at	my	campsite	from
yesterday.	Tomorrow,	I'l	finaly	make	real	headway

again.	I	was	done	driving	and	had	the	camp	set	up	by	noon.	The	efficiency	loss
here	is	15.6%.	Compared	to	the	17%	loss	at	yesterday's

camp,	this	means	I	can	outrun	the	storm	as	long	as	I	keep	heading	south.

Hopefuly.

The	storm	is	probably	circular.	They	usualy	are.	But	I	could	just	be	driving	in	to
an	alcove.	If	that's	the	case,	I'm	just	fucking	dead,	ok?

There's	only	so	much	I	can	do.

I'l	know	soon	enough.	If	the	storm	is	circular,	I	should	get	better	and	better
efficiency	every	day	until	I'm	back	to	100%.	One	I	reach

100%	that	means	I'm	completely	south	of	the	storm	and	I	can	start	going	east
again.	We'l	see.

If	there	were	no	storm,	I'd	be	going	directly	southwest	toward	my	goal.	As	it	is,
going	only	south,	I'm	not	nearly	as	fast.	I'm	traveling	90km	per	day	as	usual,	but
I	only	get	37km	closer	to	Schiapareli	because	Pythagoras	is	a	dick.	I	don't	know
when	I'l	finaly	clear	the

storm	and	be	able	to	beeline	to	Schiapareli	again.	But	one	thing's	for	sure:	My

I	am	FINALLY	past	the	god	damned	storm.	Today's	power	regen	was	100%.	No
more	dust	in	the	air.	With	the	storm	moving

perpendicular	to	my	direction	of	travel,	it	means	I'm	south	of	the	southernmost

Holy	shit.	I	just	realized	I	actualy	believe	I'l	get	to	the	MAV.	See	what	I	did
there?	I	casualy	talked	about	what	I'l	do	after	I	get	to	the	MAV.	Like	it	was
nothing.	No	big	deal.	I'm	just	going	to	pop	over	to	Schiapareli	and	hang	with	the
MAV	there.

Nice.

Anyway,	I	don't	have	another	airlock.	I've	got	one	on	the	rover	and	one	on	the
trailer	and	that's	it.	They're	firmly	fixed	in	place,	so	it's	not	like	I	can	detach	one
and	attach	it	to	the	bedroom.

But	I	can	seal	the	bedroom	entirely.	I	don't	even	have	to	do	any	bulshit	hatchet
jobs	on	it.	The	airlock	attachment	point	has	a	flap	I	can	unrol	seal	the	opening
with.	Remember,	I	stole	the	airlock	attachment	from	a	pop-tent.	It's	an
emergency	feature	for	pressure	loss	while	in	the	rover.	It'd	be	pretty	useless	if	it
couldn't	seal	itself	off.

Unfortunately,	as	an	emergency	device,	it	was	never	intended	to	be	reusable.	The
idea	was	people	seal	themselves	in	the	pop	tent,	then

the	rest	of	the	crew	drives	to	wherever	they	are	in	the	other	rover	and	rescues
them.	The	crew	of	the	good	rover	detaches	the	pop	tent

from	the	breached	rover,	and	re-attaches	it	to	theirs.	Then	they	cut	through	the
seal	from	their	side	to	recover	their	crewmates.

To	make	sure	this	would	always	be	an	option,	mission	rules	dictated	no	more
than	3	people	could	be	in	a	rover	at	once,	and	both

rovers	had	to	be	fuly	functional	or	we	couldn't	use	either.

So	here's	my	briliant	plan:	I	won't	use	the	bedroom	as	a	bedroom	anymore	once	I
get	to	the	MAV.	I'l	use	it	to	house	the	Oxygenator

and	Atmospheric	Regulator.	Then	I'l	use	the	trailer	as	my	bedroom.	Neat,	eh?

The	trailer	has	tons	of	space.	I	put	a	fuckton	of	work	in	to	making	that	happen.
The	baloon	gives	plenty	of	headroom.	Not	a	lot	of	floor	space,	but	stil	lots	of
vertical	area.

Also,	the	bedroom	has	several	valve	apertures	in	its	canvas.	I	have	the	pop-tents
to	thank	for	that	again.	I	just	needed	swaths	of	canvas	so	I	stole	it	from	wherever
I	could.	I	stole	a	lot	from	the	pop	tents,	and	they	had	valve	apertures	(triple
redundant	ones,	actualy).	NASA	wanted	to	make	sure	the	emergency	shelter
alows	the	crew	on	the	outside	to	get	air	in	to	the	crew	on	the	inside.

In	the	end,	I'l	have	the	bedroom	sealed	with	the	Oxygenator	and	Atmospheric
Regulator	inside.	It'l	be	attached	to	the	trailer	via	hoses

to	share	the	same	atmosphere	and	I'l	run	a	power	line	through	one	of	the	hoses.
The	rover	wil	serve	as	storage	(because	I	won't	need	to

get	to	the	driving	controls	any	more)	and	the	trailer	wil	be	completely	empty.
Then	I'l	have	a	permanent	bedroom.	I'l	even	be	able	to	use	it	as	a	workshop	for
whatever	MAV	modifications	I	need	to	do	on	parts	that	can	fit	through	the
trailer's	airlock.

Of	course,	if	the	Atmospheric	Regulator	or	Oxygenator	have	problems,	I'l	need
to	cut	in	to	the	bedroom	to	get	to	them.	But	I've	been

here	492	sols	and	they've	worked	fine	the	whole	time,	so	I'l	take	that	risk.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	497

I'l	be	at	the	entrance	to	Schiapareli	crater	tomorrow!

Presuming	nothing	goes	wrong,	that	is.	But	hey,	everything	else	has	gone
smoothly	this	mission,	right?	(That	was	sarcasm.)

Today's	an	Air	Day	and	for	once,	I	don't	want	it.	I'm	so	close	to	Schiapareli,	I
can	taste	it.	I	guess	it	would	taste	like	sand,	mostly,	but	that's	not	the	point.

Of	course,	that	won't	be	the	end	of	the	trip.	It'l	take	another	3	sols	to	get	from	the
entrance	to	the	MAV,	but	hot	damn!	I'm	almost

there!

I	think	I	can	even	see	the	rim	of	Schiapareli.	It's	way	the	hel	off	in	the	distance
and	it	might	just	be	my	imagination.	It's	62km	away,	so	if	I'm	seeing	it,	I'm	only
just	barely	seeing	it.

Tomorrow,	once	I	get	to	Entrance	Crater,	I'l	turn	south	and	enter	the	Schiapareli
Basin	via	the	“Entrance	Ramp.”	I	did	some	back-of-

the-napkin	math	and	the	slope	should	be	pretty	safe.	The	elevation	change	from
the	rim	to	the	basin	is	1.5km,	and	the	Ramp	is	at	least

45km	long.	That	makes	for	a	2-degree	grade.	No	problem.

Tomorrow	night,	I'l	sink	to	an	al	new	low!

Lemme	rephrase	that...

Tomorrow	night,	I'l	be	at	rock	bottom!

No,	that	doesn't	sound	good	either...

Tomorrow	night,	I'l	be	in	Giovanni	Schiapareli's	favorite	hole!

Ok,	I	admit	I'm	just	fucking	around	now.

For	milions	of	years,	the	rim	of	the	crater	had	been	under	constant	attack	from
wind.	It	eroded	the	rocky	crest	like	a	river	cuts	through	a	mountain	range.	After
aeons,	it	finaly	breached	the	edge.

The	high	pressure	zone	created	by	the	wind	now	had	an	avenue	to	drain.	The
breach	widened	more	and	more	with	each	passing

milennium.	As	it	widened,	dust	and	sand	particles	carried	along	with	the	attack
settled	in	the	basin	below.

Eventualy,	a	balance	point	was	reached.	The	sand	had	piled	up	high	enough	to	be
flush	with	the	land	outside	the	crater.	It	no	longer

built	upward,	but	now	outward.	The	slope	lengthened	until	a	new	balance	point
was	reached,	one	defined	by	the	complex	interactions	of

countless	tiny	particles	and	their	ability	to	maintain	an	angled	shape.	Entrance
Ramp	had	been	born.

The	weather	brought	dunes	and	desert	terrain.	Nearby	crater	impacts	brought
rocks	and	boulders.	The	shape	became	uneven.

Gravity	did	its	work.	The	ramp	compressed	over	time.	But	it	did	not	compress
evenly.	Differing	densities	shrunk	at	different	rates.

Some	areas	became	hard	as	rock	while	others	remained	as	soft	as	talc.

While	providing	a	smal	average	slope	into	the	crater,	the	ramp	itself	was	rugged
and	bitterly	uneven.

Upon	reaching	Entrance	Crater,	the	lone	inhabitant	of	Mars	turned	his	vehicle
toward	the	Schiapareli	Basin.	The	difficult	terrain	was

unexpected,	but	looked	no	worse	than	other	terrain	he	routinely	navigated.

He	went	around	the	smaler	dunes,	and	carefuly	crested	the	larger	ones.	He	took
care	with	every	turn,	every	rise	or	fal	in	elevation,

and	every	boulder	in	his	path.	He	thought	through	every	course	and	considered
al	alternatives.

But	it	wasn't	enough.

The	rover,	while	descending	down	a	seemingly	ordinary	slope,	drove	off	an
invisible	ridge.	The	dense,	hard	soil	suddenly	gave	way	to

soft	powder.	With	the	entire	surface	covered	by	at	least	5cm	of	dust,	there	were
no	visual	hints	to	the	sudden	change.

The	rover's	left	front	wheel	sank.	The	sudden	tilt	brought	the	right	rear	wheel
completely	off	the	ground.	This	in	turn	put	more	weight	on	the	left	rear	wheel,
which	slipped	from	it's	precarious	purchase	into	the	powder	as	wel.

Before	the	traveler	could	react,	the	rover	roled	on	to	its	side.	As	it	did,	the	solar
cels	neatly	stacked	on	the	roof	flew	off	and	scattered	like	a	dropped	deck	of
cards.

The	trailer,	attached	to	the	rover	with	a	tow	clamp,	was	dragged	along.	The
torsion	on	the	clamp	snapped	the	strong	composite	like	a

brittle	twig.	The	hoses	connecting	the	two	vehicles	also	snapped.	The	trailer
plunged	head-long	in	to	the	soft	soil	and	flipped	over	on	to	its	baloon-roof,
shuddering	to	an	abrupt	halt.

The	rover	was	not	so	lucky.	It	continued	tumbling	down	the	hil,	bouncing	the
traveler	around	like	clothes	in	a	dryer.	After	20	meters,

the	soft	powder	gave	way	to	more	solid	sand	and	it	shuddered	to	a	halt.

The	rover	had	come	to	rest	on	its	side.	The	valves	leading	to	the	now	missing
hoses	had	detected	the	sudden	pressure	drop	and	closed.

The	pressure	seal	was	not	breached.

The	traveler	was	alive	for	now.

The	department	heads	stared	at	the	satelite	image	on	the	projection	screen.

"Jesus,"	Mitch	said.	"What	the	hel	happened?"

"The	rover's	on	its	side,"	Mindy	said,	pointing	to	the	screen.	"The	trailer's	upside
down.	Those	rectangles	scattered	around	are	solar	cels."

Venkat	put	a	hand	on	his	chin.	"Do	we	have	any	information	on	the	state	of	the
rover	pressure	vessel?"

"Nothing	obvious,"	Mindy	said.

"Any	signs	of	Watney	doing	something	after	the	accident?	An	EVA	maybe?"

"No	EVA,"	Mindy	said.	"The	weather's	clear.	If	he'd	come	out	there'd	be	visible
footsteps."

"Is	this	the	entire	crash	site?"	Bruce	Ng	asked.

"I	think	so,"	Mindy	said.	"Up	toward	the	top	of	the	photo,	which	is	North,	there
are	ordinary	wheel	tracks.	Right	here,"	she	pointed	to	a	large	disturbance	in	the
soil,	"is	where	I	think	things	went	wrong.	Judging	by	where	that	ditch	is,	I'd	say
the	rover	roled	and	slid	from	there.

You	can	see	the	trench	it	left	behind.	The	trailer	flipped	forward	on	to	its	roof."

"I'm	not	saying	everything's	ok,"	Bruce	said,	"but	I	don't	think	it's	as	bad	as	it
looks."

"Go	on,"	Venkat	said.

"The	rover's	designed	to	handle	a	rol,"	Bruce	explained.	"And	if	there'd	been
pressure	loss	there'd	be	a	starburst	pattern	in	the	sand.	I	don't	see	anything	like
that."

"Watney	may	stil	be	hurt	inside,"	Mitch	said.	"He	could	have	banged	his	head	or

broken	an	arm	or	something."

"Sure,"	Bruce	said.	"I'm	just	saying	the	rover	is	probably	ok."

"When	was	this	taken?"

Mindy	checked	her	watch.	"We	got	it	17	minutes	ago.	We’l	get	another	pic	in	9
minutes	when	MGS4’s	orbit	brings	it	in	view.”

“First	thing	he’l	do	is	an	EVA	to	assess	damage,”	Venkat	said.	“Mindy,	keep	us

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	498

Hmm.

Yeah.

Things	don't	go	wel	on	the	descent	in	to	Schiapareli	Basin.	To	give	you	some
indication	of	how	unwel	they	went,	I'm	reaching	up	to

the	computer	to	type	this.	Because	it's	stil	mounted	near	the	control	panel,	and
the	rover	is	on	its	side.

I	got	bounced	around	a	lot,	but	I'm	a	wel-honed	machine	in	times	of	crisis.	As
soon	as	the	rover	toppled,	I	curled	in	to	a	bal	and

cowered.	That's	the	kind	of	action	hero	I	am.

It	worked,	too.	Cause	I'm	not	hurt.

The	pressure	vessel	is	intact,	so	that's	a	plus.	The	valves	that	lead	to	the	trailer
hoses	are	shut.	Probably	means	the	hoses	disconnected.

And	that	means	the	trailer	junction	snapped.	Wonderful.

Looking	around	the	interior	here,	I	don't	think	anything	is	broken.	The	water
tanks	stayed	sealed.	There	aren't	any	visible	leaks	in	the	air	tanks.	The	bedroom
came	unfolded	and	it's	al	over	the	place,	but	it's	just	canvas	so	it	can't	have
gotten	too	hurt.

The	driving	controls	are	ok,	and	the	Nav	Computer	is	teling	me	the	rover	is	at	an
"unacceptably	dangerous	tilt."	Thanks,	Nav!

So	I	roled.	That's	not	the	end	of	the	world.	I'm	alive	and	the	rover's	fine.	I'm
more	worried	about	the	solar	cels	I	probably	roled	over.

Also,	since	the	trailer	detached	there's	a	good	chance	it's	fucked	up,	too.	The
baloon	roof	it	has	isn't	exactly	durable.	If	it	popped,	the	shit	inside	wil	have
flung	out	in	al	directions	and	I'l	have	to	go	find	it.	That's	my	critical	life	support.

Speaking	of	life	support,	the	rover	switched	over	to	the	local	tanks	when	the
valves	shut.	Good	boy,	Rover!	Here's	a	Scooby-Snack.

I've	got	20L	of	oxygen	(enough	to	keep	me	breathing	for	40	days)	but	without
the	Regulator	(which	is	in	the	trailer)	I'm	back	to

chemical	CO2	absorption.	I	have	312	hours	of	filters	left.	Plus	I	have	another
171	hours	of	EVA	suit	CO2	filters	as	wel.	Al	told,	they'l	last	483	hours,	which	is
close	to	20	sols.	So	I	have	time	to	get	things	working	again.

I'm	realy	damn	close	to	the	MAV	now.	About	220km.	I'm	not	going	to	let
something	like	this	stop	me	from	getting	there.	And	I	don't

need	everything	to	work	at	top	form	anymore.	I	just	need	the	rover	to	work	for
220	more	kilometers	and	the	life	support	to	work	for	51

more	sols.	That's	it.

Time	to	suit	up	and	look	for	the	trailer.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	498	(2)

I	had	an	EVA	and	things	aren't	too	bad.	Mind	you,	they're	not	good.

I	trashed	3	solar	cels.	They're	under	the	rover	and	cracked	al	to	hel.	They	might
stil	be	able	to	piss	out	out	a	few	watts,	but	I'm	not

holding	out	much	hope.	I	did	come	in	to	this	with	one	extra	solar	cel.	I	needed
28	for	my	daily	operations	and	I	brought	29	(14	on	the

rover's	roof,	7on	the	trailer's	roof,	and	8	on	the	makeshift	shelves	I	instaled	on
the	sides	of	both	vehicles.)

I	tried	pushing	the	rover	over,	but	I	wasn't	strong	enough.	I'l	need	to	rig
something	to	get	a	leverage	advantage.	Other	than	being	on	its	side,	I	don't	see
any	real	problems.

Wel,	that's	not	true.	The	tow	hook	is	fucked	beyond	repair.	Half	of	it	ripped	clean
off.	Fortunately,	the	trailer	also	has	a	tow	hook,	so	I	have	a	spare.

The	trailer's	in	a	precarious	situation.	It's	upside-down	and	sitting	on	the	inflated
roof.	I'm	not	sure	which	god	smiled	down	on	me	and	kept	that	baloon	from
popping,	but	I'm	grateful.	My	first	priority	wil	be	righting	it.	The	longer	it	puts
weight	on	that	baloon,	the	larger	the	chances	it'l	pop.

While	I	was	out,	I	colected	the	26	solar	cels	that	aren't	under	the	rover	and	set
them	up	to	recharge	my	batteries.	May	as	wel,	right?

So	right	now,	I	have	a	few	problems	to	tackle:	First,	I	need	to	right	the	trailer.	Or
at	least	get	the	weight	off	the	baloon.	Next,	I	need	to	right	the	rover.	Finaly,	I
need	to	replace	the	rover's	tow	hook	with	the	one	on	the	trailer.

Also,	I	should	spel	out	a	message	for	NASA.	They're	probably	worried.

Mindy	read	the	Morse	code	aloud.	“Roled.	Fixing	now.”

“What?	That's	it?”	Venkat	said	over	the	phone.

“That's	al	he	said,”	she	reported,	cradling	the	phone	as	she	typed	out	an	email	to
the	list	of	interested	parties.

“Just	three	words?	Nothing	about	his	physical	health?	His	equipment?	His
supplies?”

“You	got	me,”	she	said.	“He	left	a	detailed	status	report.	I	just	decided	to	lie	for
no	reason.”

“Funny,”	Venkat	said.	“Be	a	smart-ass	to	a	guy	seven	levels	above	you	at	your
company.	See	how	that	works	out.”

“Oh	no,”	Mindy	said.	“I	might	lose	my	job	as	an	interplanetary	voyeur?	I	guess
I'd	have	to	use	my	Master's	degree	for	something	else.”

“I	remember	when	you	were	shy.”

“I'm	space	paparazzi	now.	The	attitude	comes	with	the	job.”

“Yeah,	yeah,”	Venkat	said.	“Just	send	the	email.”

“Already	sent.”

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	499

I	had	a	busy	day	today	and	I	got	a	lot	done.

I	started	out	pretty	sore.	I	had	to	sleep	on	the	wal	of	the	rover.	The	bedroom
won't	work	when	the	airlock	is	facing	up.	I	did	get	to	use	the	bedroom,
somewhat.	I	folded	it	up	and	used	it	as	a	bed.

Anyway,	suffice	to	say	the	wal	of	the	rover	wasn't	made	for	sleeping	on.	But
after	a	morning	potato	and	Vicodin,	I	was	feeling	much

better.

At	first	I	figured	my	top	priority	was	the	trailer.	Then	I	changed	my	mind.	After
taking	a	good	look	at	it,	I	decided	I'd	never	be	able	to	right	it	by	myself.	I'd	need
the	rover.

So	today	was	focused	on	getting	the	rover	righted.

I	brought	al	my	tools	along	on	this	trip,	figuring	I'd	need	them	for	the	MAV
modifications.	And	along	with	them	I	brought	cabling.	Once

I	get	set	up	at	the	MAV,	my	solar	cels	and	batteries	wil	be	in	a	fixed	position.	I
don't	want	to	move	the	rover	around	every	time	I	use	a	dril	on	the	far	side	of	the
MAV.	So	I	brought	al	the	electrical	cabling	I	could	fit.

Good	thing,	too.	Because	it	doubles	as	rope.

I	dug	up	my	longest	cable.	It's	the	same	one	I	used	to	power	the	dril	that
destroyed	Pathfinder.	I	cal	it	my	“Lucky	Cable.”

I	plugged	one	end	in	to	the	battery	and	the	other	in	to	the	infamous	sample	dril.
Then	walked	off	with	the	dril	to	find	solid	ground.

Once	I	found	it,	I	kept	going	until	I'd	gone	as	far	as	the	electrical	line	would
reach.	I	drove	a	1-meter	bit	half	a	meter	into	a	rock,	unplugged	the	power	line,
and	tied	it	around	the	base	of	the	bit.

Then	I	went	back	to	the	rover	and	tied	off	the	cord	to	the	roof-rack	bar	on	the
high	side.	Now	I	had	a	long,	taut	line	running

perpendicular	to	the	rover.

I	walked	to	the	middle	of	the	cord	and	puled	it	lateraly.	The	leverage	advantage
on	the	rover	was	huge.	I	only	hoped	it	wouldn't	break

the	dril	bit	before	it	tipped	the	rover.

I	backed	away,	puling	the	line	more	and	more.	Something	had	to	give,	and	it
wasn't	going	to	be	me.	I	had	Archimedes	on	my	side.	The

rover	finaly	tipped.

It	fel	on	to	its	wheels,	kicking	up	a	large	cloud	of	soft	dust.	It	was	a	silent	affair.	I
was	far	enough	away	that	the	thin	atmosphere	had	no	hope	of	carrying	the	sound
to	me.

I	untied	the	power	line,	liberated	the	dril	bit,	and	returned	to	the	rover.	I	gave	it	a
ful	system's	check.	That's	a	boring-as-hel	task	but	I	had	to	do	it.	Every	system
and	subsystem	was	working	correctly.

JPL	did	a	damn	good	job	making	these	rovers.	If	I	get	back	to	Earth,	I'm	buying
Bruce	Ng	a	beer.	Though	I	guess	I	should	buy	al	the

JPL	guys	a	beer.

Beers	for	fucking	everyone	if	I	get	back	to	Earth.

Anyway,	with	the	rover	back	on	its	wheels	it	was	time	to	work	on	the	trailer.
Problem	is,	I'm	in	a	crater.

I	had	gotten	most	of	the	way	down	the	Ramp	when	I	roled	the	rover.	And	the
Ramp	is	up	against	the	western	edge	of	the	crater.	So

the	sun	sets	realy	early	from	my	point	of	view.	I'm	in	the	shadow	of	the	western
wal.	And	that	royaly	sucks.

Mars	is	not	Earth.	It	doesn't	have	a	thick	atmosphere	to	bend	light	and	carry
particles	that	reflect	light	around	corners.	It's	damn-near	a	vacuum	here.	Once
the	sun	isn't	visible,	I'm	in	the	dark.	Phobos	gives	me	some	moonlight,	but	not
enough	to	work	with.	Deimos	is	a	little	piece	of	shit	that's	no	good	to	anyone.

Long	story	short:	I	ran	out	of	daylight.	I	hate	to	leave	the	trailer	sitting	on	its
baloon	for	another	night,	but	there's	not	much	else	I	can	do.	I	figure	it's	survived
a	whole	day	like	that.	It's	probably	stable	for	now.

And	hey,	with	the	rover	righted,	I	get	to	use	the	bedroom	again!	It's	the	simple
things	in	life	that	matter.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	500

When	I	woke	up	this	morning,	the	trailer	hadn't	popped	yet.	So	that	was	a	good
start.

The	trailer	was	a	bigger	chalenge	than	the	rover.	I	only	had	to	tip	the	rover.	I'd
need	to	completely	flip	the	trailer.	That	requires	lot	more	force	than	yesterday's
little	leverage	trick.

The	first	step	was	to	drive	the	rover	to	near	the	trailer.	Then	came	the	digging.

Oh	god	the	digging.

The	trailer	was	upside	down	with	its	nose	pointed	downhil.	I	decided	the	best
way	to	right	it	was	to	take	advantage	of	the	slope	and

rol	the	trailer	over	its	nose.	Basicaly	to	make	it	do	a	somersault	to	land	on	its
wheels.

I	can	make	this	happen	by	tying	off	the	cable	to	the	rear	of	the	trailer	and	towing
with	the	rover.	But	if	I	tried	that	without	digging	a	hole	first,	the	trailer	would
just	slide	along	the	ground.	I	needed	it	to	tip	up.	I	needed	a	hole	for	the	nose	to

fal	in	to.

So	I	dug	a	hole.	A	hole	one	by	three	meters,	and	one	meter	deep.	It	took	me	four
miserable	hours	of	hard	labor,	but	I	got	it	done.

I	hopped	in	the	rover	and	drove	it	downhil,	dragging	the	trailer	with	me.	As	I'd
hoped,	the	trailer	nosed	in	to	the	hole	and	tipped	up.

From	there,	it	fel	on	to	its	wheels	with	a	huge	plume	of	dust.

Then	I	sat	for	a	moment,	dumbstruck	that	my	plan	actualy	worked.

And	now	I'm	out	of	daylight	again.	I	can't	wait	to	get	out	of	this	fucking	shadow.
Al	I	need	is	one	day	of	driving	toward	the	MAV	and

I'l	be	away	from	the	wal.	But	for	now,	it's	another	early	night.

I'l	spend	tonight	without	the	trailer	to	manage	my	life	support.	It	may	be	righted,
but	I	have	no	idea	if	the	shit	inside	stil	works.	The	rover	stil	has	ample	supplies
for	me.

I'l	spend	the	rest	of	the	evening	enjoying	a	potato.	And	by	“enjoying”	I	mean
“hating	so	much	I	want	to	kil	people.”

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	501

I	started	the	day	with	some	Nothin'	Tea.	Nothin'	Tea	is	easy	to	make.	First,	get
some	hot	water,	then	add	nothin'.	I	experimented	with

Potato	Skin	Tea	a	few	weeks	ago.	The	less	said	about	that	the	better.

I	ventured	in	to	the	trailer	today.	Not	an	easy	task.	It's	pretty	cramped	in	there;	I
had	to	leave	my	EVA	suit	in	the	airlock.

The	first	thing	I	noticed	was	that	it	was	realy	hot	in	there.	It	took	me	a	few
minutes	to	work	out	why.

The	Atmospheric	Regulator	was	stil	in	perfect	working	order,	but	it	had	nothing
to	do.	Without	being	connected	to	the	rover,	it	no

longer	had	my	CO2	production	to	deal	with.	The	atmosphere	in	the	trailer	was

perfect,	why	change	anything?

With	no	regulation	necessary,	the	air	was	not	being	pumped	out	to	the	AREC	for
freeze-separation.	And	thus	it	wasn't	coming	back	in

as	a	liquid	in	need	of	heating.

But	remember,	the	RTG	gives	off	heat	al	the	time.	You	can't	stop	it.	So	the	heat
just	built	up.	Eventualy,	things	reached	a	balance	point	where	the	heat	bled
through	the	hul	as	fast	as	the	RTG	could	add	it.	If	you're	curious,	that	balance
point	was	a	sweltering	41C.

I	did	a	ful	diagnostic	on	the	Regulator	and	Oxygenator	and	I'm	happy	to	report
both	are	working	perfectly.

The	RTG's	water	tank	was	empty,	which	is	no	surprise.	It	was	an	open	top,	not
intended	to	be	turned	upside	down.	The	floor	of	the

trailer	has	a	lot	of	puddled	water	that	took	me	quite	a	while	to	sop	up	with	my
jumpsuit.	I	topped	the	tank	off	with	some	more	water	from	a	sealed	container
that	I'd	stored	in	the	trailer	earlier.	Remember,	I	need	that	water	to	have
something	for	the	returning	air	to	bubble	through.

That's	my	heating	system.

But	al	things	considered,	it	was	good	news.	The	critical	components	are	working
fine,	and	both	vehicles	are	back	on	their	tires.

The	hoses	that	connected	the	rover	and	trailer	were	designed	wel,	and	released
without	breaking.	I	simply	snapped	them	back	in	to

place	and	the	vehicles	were	sharing	life	support	again.

The	one	remaining	thing	to	fix	was	the	tow	hook.	It	was	absolutely	ruined.	It
took	the	ful	force	of	the	crash.	As	I	suspected,	the	trailer's	tow	hook	was
unscathed.	So	I	transferred	it	to	the	rover	and	reconnected	the	two	vehicles	for
travel.

Al	told,	that	little	fender-bender	cost	me	4	sols.	But	now	I'm	back	in	action!

Sort	of.

What	if	I	run	in	to	another	powder	pit?	I	got	lucky	this	time.	Next	time	I	might
not	get	off	so	easy.	I	think	this	was	sort	of	a	freak

accident.	The	problem	was	that	one	wheel	was	on	solid	ground	while	the	other
was	on	soft	powder.

I	need	a	way	to	know	if	the	ground	in	front	of	me	is	safe.	At	least	for	the
duration	of	my	time	on	The	Ramp.	Once	I'm	in	the	Schiapareli	Basin	proper,	I
can	count	on	the	normal	sandy	terrain	I'm	used	to.

If	I	could	have	anything,	it	would	be	a	radio	to	ask	NASA	the	safe	path	down	the
Ramp.	Wel,	if	I	could	have	anything,	it	would	be	for	the	green-skinned	yet
beautiful	Queen	of	Mars	to	rescue	me	so	she	can	learn	more	about	this	Earth
thing	caled	“lovemaking”.

It's	been	a	long	time	since	I've	seen	a	woman.	Just	sayin'.

Anyway,	to	ensure	I	don't	crash	again,	I'l--	Seriously...	no	women	in	like,	years.	I
don't	ask	for	much.	And	believe	me,	a	Botanist	/

Mechanical	Engineer	doesn't	exactly	have	ladies	lined	up	at	the	door.	But	stil,
c'mon.

Anyway.	I'l	drive	slower.	Like...	a	crawl.	That	should	give	me	enough	time	to
react	if	one	wheel	starts	to	sink.	Also,	the	lower	speed

wil	give	me	more	torque,	making	it	less	likely	I	lose	traction.

Up	til	now	I've	been	driving	25kph,	so	I'm	going	to	cut	that	to	5kph.	I'm	stil
toward	the	top	of	the	Ramp,	but	the	whole	thing	is	only

40km.	I	can	take	my	time	and	get	safely	to	the	bottom.	It	should	take	about	8
hours.

I'l	do	it	tomorrow.	I'm	already	out	of	daylight	again	today.	That's	another	bonus:
Once	I	clear	the	ramp,	I	can	start	bee-lining	toward

the	MAV,	which	wil	take	me	away	from	the	crater	wal.	I'l	be	back	to	enjoying

the	entire	day's	sunlight	instead	of	just	half	of	it.

If	I	get	back	to	Earth,	I'l	be	famous,	right?	A	fearless	astronaut	who	beat	al	the
odds,	right?	I	bet	women	like	that.

More	motivation	to	stay	alive.

“So	it	looks	like	he's	fixed	everything,”	Mindy	explained.	“And	his	message
today	was	'ALL	BETTER	NOW'	so	I	guess	he's	got

everything	working.”

She	surveyed	the	smiling	faces	of	the	meeting	room.

“Awesome.”	Mitch	said.

“Great	news,”	Bruce's	voice	came	in	through	the	speakerphone.

Venkat	leaned	forward	to	the	speakerphone	“How	are	the	MAV	modification
plans	coming,	Bruce?	Is	JPL	going	to	have	that

procedure	soon?”

“We're	working	around	the	clock	on	it,”	Bruce	said.	“We're	past	most	of	the	big
hurdles.	Working	out	the	details	now.”

“Good,	good,”	Venkat	said.	“Any	surprises	I	should	know	about?”

“Um...”	Bruce	said.	“Yeah,	a	few.	This	might	not	be	the	best	venue	for	it.	I'l	be
back	in	Houston	with	the	procedure	in	a	day	or	two.

We	can	go	through	it	then.”

“Ominous,”	Venkat	said.	“But	ok.	We'l	pick	it	up	later.”

“Can	I	spread	the	word?”	Annie	asked.	“It'd	be	nice	to	see	something	other	than
the	rover	crash	site	on	the	news	tonight.”

“Definitely,”	Venkat	said.	“It'l	be	nice	to	have	some	good	news	for	a	change.
Mindy,	how	long	until	he	gets	to	the	MAV?”

“At	his	usual	rate	of	90km	per	sol,”	Mindy	said,	“he	should	get	there	on	Sol	504.
Sol	505	if	he	takes	his	time.	He	always	drives	in	the

early	morning,	finishing	around	noon.”	She	checked	an	application	on	her
laptop.	“Noon	on	Sol	504	wil	be	11:41am	this	Wednesday	here

in	Houston.	Noon	on	Sol	505	wil	be	12:21pm	on	Thursday.”

“Mitch,	who's	handling	Ares	4	MAV	communication?”

“The	Ares	3	mission	control	team,”	Mitch	replied.	“It'l	be	in	control	room	2”.

“I	assume	you'l	be	there?”

“Bet	your	ass	I'l	be	there.”

“So	wil	I.”

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	502

Every	Thanksgiving,	my	family	used	to	drive	from	Chicago	to	Sandusky,	an	8-
hour	drive.	It's	where	Mom's	sister	lived.	Dad	would

always	drive,	and	he	was	the	slowest,	most	cautious	driver	who	ever	took	the
wheel.

Seriously.	He	drove	like	he	was	taking	a	driver's	test.	Never	exceeded	the	speed
limit,	always	had	his	hands	at	10	and	2,	adjusted

mirrors	before	each	outing,	you	name	it.

It	was	infuriating.	We'd	be	on	the	freeway,	cars	blowing	by	left	and	right.	Some
of	them	would	blare	their	horns	because,	honestly,

driving	the	speed	limit	makes	you	a	road	hazard.	I	wanted	to	get	out	and	push.

I	felt	that	way	al	damn	day	today.	5km/h	is	literaly	a	walking	pace.	And	I	drove
that	speed	for	eight	hours.

But	the	slow	speed	ensured	that	I	wouldn't	fal	in	to	anymore	powder	pits	along
the	way.	And	of	course	I	didn't	encounter	any.	I	could

have	driven	ful	speed	and	had	no	problems.	But	better	safe	than	sorry.

The	good	news	is	I'm	off	the	Ramp.	I	camped	out	as	soon	as	the	terrain	flattened
out.	I've	already	overdone	my	driving	time	for	the

day.	I	could	go	further,	I	stil	have	15%	battery	power	or	so,	but	I	want	to	get	as
much	daylight	on	my	solar	cels	as	I	can.

I'm	in	the	Schiapareli	Basin	at	last!	Far	from	the	crater	wal,	too.	I	get	a	ful	day	of
sunlight	every	day	from	now	on.

I	decided	it	was	time	for	a	very	special	occasion.	I	ate	the	meal	pack	labeled
“Survived	Something	That	Should	Have	Kiled	Me.”	Oh

my	god,	I	forgot	how	good	real	food	tastes.

With	luck,	I'l	get	to	eat	“Arrival”	in	a	few	sols.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	503

I	didn't	get	as	much	recharge	I	usualy	would	yesterday.	Because	of	my	extended
driving	time,	I	only	recharged	to	70%	before	night

fel.	So	today's	driving	was	abbreviated.

I	got	63km	before	I	had	to	camp	out	again.	But	I	don't	even	mind.	Because	I'm
only	148km	from	the	MAV.	That	means	I'l	get	there

the	sol	after	tomorrow.

Holy	hel,	I'm	realy	going	to	make	it!

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	504

Holy	shit	this	is	awesome!	Holy	shit!	Holy	shit!

Ok	calm.	Calm.

I	made	90km	today.	By	my	estimate,	I'm	50km	from	the	MAV.	I	should	get	there
some	time	tomorrow.	I'm	excited	about	that,	but

here's	what	I'm	realy	stoked	about:	I	caught	a	blip	from	the	MAV!

NASA	has	the	MAV	broadcasting	the	Ares	3	Hab	homing	signal.	Why	wouldn't
they?	It	makes	perfect	sense.	Unlike	my	worn	out

shit,	the	MAV	is	a	sleek,	perfectly	functional	machine,	ready	to	do	what	it's	told.
And	they	have	it	pretending	to	be	the	Ares	3	Hab	so	my	rover	wil	see	the	signal
and	tel	me	where	it	is.

That	is	an	exceptionally	good	idea!	I	won't	have	to	wander	around	looking	for
the	thing.	I'm	going	straight	to	it.

I	only	caught	a	blip.	I'l	get	more	as	I	get	closer.	It	has	three	redundant	methods	of
communicating	with	Earth,	but	they're	extremely

directed	and	are	designed	for	line-of-sight	communication.	It's	strange	to	think
that	a	sand	dune	wil	stop	me	from	hearing	what	the	MAV

has	to	say,	but	it	can	talk	to	Earth	no	problem.	Wel,	there	aren't	any	sand	dunes
between	it	and	Earth	when	they	talk.

Somehow	they	messed	with	things	to	make	a	radial	signal,	however	weak	it	may
be.	And	I	heard	it!

My	message	for	the	day	was	“GOT	BEACON	SIGNAL.”	If	I'd	had	enough
rocks,	I	would	have	added	“AWESOME	FUCKING

IDEA!!!”	But	it's	a	realy	sandy	area.

The	MAV	waited	in	southwestern	Schiapareli.	It	stood	an	impressive	27	meters
tal,	its	conical	body	gleaming	in	the	midday	sun.

The	rover	crested	a	nearby	dune	with	the	trailer	in	tow.	It	slowed	for	a	few
moments,	then	continued	toward	the	ship	at	top	speed.	It

came	to	a	stop	20	meters	away.

There	it	remained	for	ten	minutes	while	the	astronaut	inside	suited	up.

He	stumbled	excitedly	out	of	the	airlock,	faling	to	the	ground	then	scrambling	to

his	feet.	Beholding	the	MAV,	he	gestured	to	it	with

both	arms,	as	if	in	disbelief.

He	leaped	in	to	the	air	several	times,	arms	held	high	with	fists	clenched.	Then	he
knelt	on	one	knee	and	fist-pumped	repeatedly.

Running	to	the	spacecraft,	he	hugged	Landing	Strut	B.	After	a	few	moments,	he
broke	off	the	embrace	to	perform	another	round	of

leaping	celebrations.

Now	fatigued,	the	astronaut	stood	with	arms	akimbo,	looking	up	at	the	sleek
lines	of	the	engineering	marvel	before	him.

Climbing	the	ladder	on	the	landing	stage,	he	reached	the	ascent	stage	and	entered
the	airlock.	He	sealed	the	door	behind	him.

I	finaly	made	it!	I'm	at	the	MAV!

Wel,	right	this	second,	I'm	back	in	the	rover.	I	did	go	in	to	the	MAV	to	do	a
systems	check	and	boot-up.	I	had	to	keep	my	EVA	suit

on	the	whole	time	because	there's	no	life	support	in	there	just	yet.

It's	going	through	a	self	check	right	now,	and	I'm	feeding	it	oxygen	and	nitrogen
with	hoses	from	the	rover.	This	is	al	part	of	the	MAV's	design.	It	doesn't	bring	air
along.	Why	would	it?	That's	a	needless	weight	when	you'l	have	a	Hab	ful	of	air
right	next	door.

I'm	guessing	folks	at	NASA	are	popping	champagne	right	now	and	sending	me
lots	of	messages.	I'l	read	them	in	a	bit.	First	things	first:

Get	the	MAV	some	life	support.	Then	I'l	be	able	to	work	comfortably	inside.

And	then	I'l	have	a	boring	conversation	with	NASA.	The	content	may	be
interesting,	but	the	14-minute	transmission	time	between	here

and	Earth	wil	be	a	bit	dul.

[13:07]HOUSTON:	Congratulations	from	all	of	us	here	at	Mission	Control!	Well

done!	What's	your	status?

[13:21]MAV:	Thanks!	No	health	or	physical	problems.	The	rover	and	trailer	are

getting	pretty	worn	out,	but	still	functional.	Oxygenator	and	Regulator	both

working	fine.	I	didn't	bring	the	Water	Reclaimer.	Just	brought	the	water.	Plenty
of

potatoes	left.	I'm	good	to	last	till	549.

[13:36]HOUSTON:	Glad	to	hear	it.	Hermes	is	still	on	track	for	a	Sol	549	flyby.
As

you	know,	the	MAV	will	need	to	lose	some	weight	to	make	the	intercept.	We're
going

to	get	you	those	procedures	within	the	day.	How	much	water	do	you	have?	What
did

you	do	with	urine?

[13:50]MAV:	I	have	550L	of	remaining	water.	I've	been	dumping	urine	outside
along

the	way.

[14:05]HOUSTON:	Preserve	all	water.	Don't	do	any	more	urine	dumps.	Store	it

somewhere.	Turn	the	rover's	radio	on	and	leave	it	on.	We	can	contact	it	through

MAV.

“So	is	it	ready?”	Venkat	asked.

“Yes,	it's	ready.”	Bruce	said.	“But	you're	not	going	to	like	it.”

“Go	on.”

“Bear	in	mind,”	Bruce	said,	producing	a	booklet	from	his	briefcase,	“This	is	the
end	result	of	thousands	of	hours	of	work,	testing,	and

lateral	thinking	by	al	the	best	guys	at	JPL.”

“I'm	sure	it	was	hard	to	trim	down	a	ship	that's	already	designed	to	be	as	light	as
possible,”	Venkat	said.

Bruce	slid	the	booklet	across	the	desk	to	Venkat.	“The	problem	is	the	intercept
velocity.	The	MAV	is	designed	to	get	to	Low	Mars

Orbit,	which	is	4.1kps.	But	the	Hermes	flyby	wil	be	5.8kps.”

Venkat	flipped	through	the	pages.	“Care	to	summarize?”

“Firstly,	we're	going	to	add	fuel.	The	MAV	makes	its	own	fuel	from	the	Martian
atmosphere,	but	it's	limited	by	how	much	Hydrogen	it

has.	It	brought	enough	to	make	19,397kg	of	fuel,	as	it	was	designed	to	do.	If	we
can	give	it	more	hydrogen,	it	can	make	more.”

“How	much	more?”

“For	every	kilogram	of	hydrogen,	it	can	make	13	kilograms	of	fuel.	Watney	has
550	liters	of	water.	We'l	have	him	electrolyze	it	to	get

60kg	of	Hydrogen.”	Bruce	reached	over	the	desk	and	flipped	a	few	pages,
pointing	to	a	diagram.	“The	fuel	plant	can	make	780kg	of	fuel

from	that.”

“If	he	electrolyzes	his	water	what'l	he	drink?”

“He	can	electrolyze	urine,	so	we	only	need	to	set	a	few	liters	aside	for	the	last
couple	of	days.”

“I	see.	And	what	does	780kg	of	fuel	buy	us?”	Venkat	asked.

“It	buys	us	300kg	of	payload.	It's	al	about	fuel	versus	payload.	The	MAV's
launch	weight	is	over	12,600kg.	We	need	to	get	that	down

to	7,300kg.	That's	accounting	for	the	bonus	fuel.	So	the	rest	of	this	booklet	is
how	to	remove	over	five	thousand	kilograms	from	the	ship.”

Venkat	leaned	back.	“Walk	me	through	it.”

Bruce	puled	another	copy	of	the	booklet	from	his	briefcase.	“There	were	some
gimmies	right	off	the	bat.	The	design	presumes	500kg

of	Martian	soil	and	rock	samples.	Obviously	we	won't	do	that.	Also,	there's	just
one	passenger	instead	of	six.	That	saves	500kg	when	you	consider	their	weight
plus	their	suits	and	gear.	And	we	can	lose	the	other	5	acceleration	chairs.	And	of
course,	we'l	remove	al	nonessential	gear.	The	med	kit,	tool	kit,	internal

harnessing,	straps,	and	anything	else	that	isn't	nailed	down.	And	some	stuff	that
is.

“Next	up,”	he	continued,	“We're	ditching	al	life	support.	The	tanks,	pumps,
heaters,	air	lines,	CO2	absorption	system,	even	the

insulation	on	the	inner	side	of	the	hul.	We	don't	need	it.	We'l	have	Watney	wear
his	EVA	suit	for	the	whole	trip.”

“Won't	that	make	it	awkward	for	him	to	use	the	controls?”	Venkat	asked.

“He	won't	use	any	controls,”	Bruce	said.	“Major	Martinez	wil	pilot	the	MAV
remotely	from	Hermes.	It's	already	designed	for	remote

piloting.	It	was	remotely	landed,	after	al.”

“What	if	something	goes	wrong?”	Venkat	asked.

“Martinez	is	the	best	trained	pilot,”	Bruce	said.	“If	there	is	an	emergency,	he's
the	guy	you	want	controling	the	ship.”

“Hmm,”	Venkat	said	cautiously.	“We've	never	had	a	manned	ship	controled
remotely	before.	But	ok.	Go	on.”

“Since	Watney	won't	be	flying	the	ship,”	Bruce	continued,	“he	won't	need	any	of
those	controls.	We'l	ditch	the	control	panels	and	al

the	power	and	data	lines	that	lead	to	them.”

“Wow,”	Venkat	said.	“We're	realy	gutting	this	thing.”

“I'm	just	getting	started,”	Bruce	said.	“The	power	needs	wil	be	dramaticaly
reduced	now	that	life	support	is	gone,	so	we'l	dump	three

of	the	five	batteries	and	the	auxiliary	power	system.	The	Orbital	Maneuvering
System	has	3	redundant	thrusters.	We'l	get	rid	of	those.

Also,	the	secondary	and	tertiary	comm	systems	can	go.”

“Wait,	what?”	Venkat	said,	shocked.	“You're	going	to	have	a	remote	controled
ascent	with	no	backup	comm	systems?”

“No	point,”	Bruce	said.	“If	the	comm	system	goes	out	during	ascent,	the	time	it
takes	to	reacquire	wil	be	too	long	to	do	any	good.	The

backups	don't	help	us.”

“This	is	getting	realy	risky,	Bruce.”

Bruce	sighed.	“I	know,	Venkat.	There's	just	no	other	way.	And	I'm	not	even	to
the	nasty	stuff	yet.”

Venkat	rubbed	his	forehead.	“By	al	means,	tel	me	the	nasty	stuff.”

“We'l	remove	the	nose	airlock,	the	windows,	and	Hul	Panel	19.”

Venkat	blinked.	“You're	taking	the	front	of	the	ship	off?”

“Sure,”	Bruce	said.	“The	nose	airlock	alone	is	400kg.	The	windows	are	pretty
damn	heavy,	too.	And	they're	connected	by	Hul	Panel

19	so	may	as	wel	take	that,	too.”

“So	he's	going	to	launch	with	a	big	hole	in	the	front	of	the	ship?”

“We'l	have	him	cover	it	with	Hab	canvas.”

“Hab	canvas?	For	a	launch	to	orbit!?”

Bruce	shrugged.	“The	hul's	mostly	there	to	keep	the	air	in.	Mars's	atmosphere	is
so	thin	you	don't	need	a	lot	of	streamlining.	By	the

time	the	ship's	going	fast	enough	for	air	resistance	to	matter,	it'l	be	high	enough
that	there's	practicaly	no	air.	We've	run	al	the	simulations.

Should	be	good.”

“You're	sending	him	to	space	under	a	tarp.”

“Pretty	much,	yeah.”

“Like	a	hastily	loaded	pick	up	truck.”

“Yeah.	Can	I	go	on?”

“Sure,	can't	wait.”

“We'l	also	have	him	remove	the	back	panel	of	the	pressure	vessel.	It's	the	only
other	panel	he	can	remove	with	the	tools	on-hand.

Also,	we're	getting	rid	of	the	auxiliary	fuel	pump.	Sad	to	see	it	go,	but	it	weighs
too	much	for	its	usefulness.	And	we're	nixing	a	Stage	One	engine.”

“An	engine?”

“Yeah.	The	Stage	One	booster	works	fine	if	one	engine	goes	out.	It'l	save	us	a
huge	amount	of	weight.	Only	during	the	Stage	One

ascent,	but	stil.	Pretty	good	fuel	savings.”

Bruce	fel	silent.

“That	it?”	Venkat	asked.

“Yeah.”

Venkat	sighed.	“You've	removed	most	of	the	safety	backups.	What's	this	do	to
the	estimated	odds	of	failure?”

“It's	about	4%.”

“Jesus	Christ.”	Venkat	said.	“Normaly	we'd	never	even	consider	something	that
risky.”

“It's	al	we've	got,	Venk,”	Bruce	said.	“We've	tested	it	al	out	and	run	simulations
galore.	We	should	be	ok	if	everything	works	the	way

its	supposed	to.”

“Yeah.	Great.”	Venkat	said.

[08:41]MAV:	You	fucking	kidding	me?

[09:55]HOUSTON:	Admittedly,	they	are	very	invasive	modifications,	but	they

have

to	be	done.	The	procedure	doc	we	sent	has	instructions	for	each	of	these	steps
with

tools	you	have	on	hand.	Also,	you'll	need	to	start	electrolyzing	water	to	get	the

hydrogen	for	the	fuel	plant.	We'll	send	you	procedures	for	that	shortly.

[09:09]MAV:	You're	sending	me	into	space	in	a	convertible.

[09:24]HOUSTON:	There	will	be	Hab	canvas	covering	the	holes.	It	will	provide

enough	aerodynamics	in	Mars's	atmosphere.

[09:38]MAV:	So	it's	a	ragtop.	Much	better.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	506

On	the	way	here,	in	my	copious	free	time,	I	designed	a	“workshop.”	I	figured	I'd
need	space	to	work	on	stuff	without	having	to	wear

an	EVA	suit.	I	devised	a	briliant	plan	whereby	the	current	bedroom	would
become	the	new	home	of	the	Regulator	and	Oxygenator,	and

the	now-empty	trailer	would	become	my	workshop.

It's	a	stupid	idea	and	I'm	not	doing	it.

Al	I	need	is	a	pressurized	area	that	I	can	work	in.	I	somehow	convinced	myself
that	the	bedroom	wasn't	an	option	because	it's	a	hassle

to	get	stuff	into	it.	But	it	won't	be	that	bad.

It	attaches	to	the	rover	airlock,	so	the	only	way	to	get	stuff	in	is	annoying.	Bring
the	stuff	into	the	rover,	attach	the	bedroom	to	the	airlock	from	the	inside,	inflate
it,	bring	the	stuff	in	to	the	bedroom.	I'l	also	have	to	empty	the	bedroom	of	al
tools	and	equipment	to	fold	it	up	any	time	I	need	to	do	an	EVA.

So	yeah,	it'l	be	annoying,	but	al	it	costs	me	is	time.	And	I'm	actualy	doing	wel	on
that	front.	I	have	43	more	sols	before	Hermes	flies

by.	And	looking	at	the	procedure	NASA	has	in	mind	for	the	modifications,	I	can
take	advantage	of	the	MAV	itself	as	a	workspace.

The	lunatics	at	NASA	have	me	doing	al	kinds	of	rape	to	the	MAV,	but	I	don't
have	to	open	the	hul	til	the	end.	So	the	first	thing	I'l	do

is	clear	out	a	bunch	of	clutter,	like	chairs	and	control	panels	and	the	like.	Once
they're	out,	I'l	have	a	lot	of	room	in	there	to	work.

But	I	didn't	do	anything	to	the	soon-to-be-mutilated	MAV	today.	Today	was	al
about	system	checks.	Now	that	I'm	back	in	contact

with	NASA,	I	have	to	go	back	to	being	al	“safety	first.”	Strangely,	NASA	doesn't
have	total	faith	in	my	kludged-together	rover	or	my

method	of	piling	everything	into	the	trailer.	They	had	me	do	a	ful	systems	check
on	every	single	component.

Everything's	stil	working	fine,	though	it's	wearing	down.	The	Regulator	and
Oxygenator	are	less	than	peak	efficiency	(to	say	the	least)

and	the	trailer	leaks	some	air	every	day.	Not	enough	to	cause	problems,	but	it's
not	a	perfect	seal.	NASA's	pretty	uncomfortable	with	it,	but	we	don't	have	any
other	options.

Then,	they	had	me	run	a	ful	diagnostic	on	the	MAV.	That's	in	much	better	shape.
Everything's	sleek	and	pristine	and	perfectly

functional.	I'd	almost	forgotten	what	new	hardware	even	looks	like.

Pity	I'm	going	to	tear	it	apart.

“You	kiled	Watney,”	Lewis	said.

“Yeah,”	Martinez	said,	scowling	at	his	monitor.	The	words	“Colision	with
Terrain”	blinked	accusingly.

“I	puled	a	nasty	trick	on	him,”	Johanssen	said.	“I	gave	him	a	malfunctioning
altitude	readout	and	made	engine	3	cut	out	too	early.	It's	a	deadly	combination.”

“Shouldn't	have	been	a	mission	failure,”	Martinez	said.	“I	should	have	noticed
the	readout	was	wrong.	It	was	way	off.”

“Don't	sweat	it,”	Lewis	said.	“That's	why	we	dril.	You've	stil	got	three	weeks	to
get	it	right.”

“Wil	do,”	Martinez	said.

“We	only	got	a	week	of	remote	launch	training,”	Johanssen	said.	“It	was	only
supposed	to	happen	if	we	scrubbed	before	landing.	We'd

launch	the	MAV	to	have	it	act	as	a	satelite.	It	was	a	cut-your-losses	scenario.”

“It's	mission-critical	now,”	Lewis	said.	“So	get	it	right.”

“Aye,	Commander.”	Martinez	said.

“Resetting	the	Sim,”	Johanssen	said.	“Anything	specific	you	want	to	try?”

“Surprise	me,”	Martinez	said.

Leaving	the	control	room,	Lewis	made	her	way	to	the	reactor.	Climbing	“up”	the
ladder	toward	the	center	of	the	ship,	the	centripetal

force	on	her	diminished	to	nearly	zero	as	she	reached	the	core.	Vogel	looked	up
from	a	computer	console.	“Commander?”

“How	are	the	engines?”	She	asked,	grabbing	a	wal-mounted	handle	to	stay
attached	to	the	slowly	turning	room.

“Al	working	within	tolerance,”	Vogel	said.	“I	am	now	doing	a	diagnostic	on	the
reactor.	I	am	thinking	that	Johanssen	is	busy	with	the

launching	training.	So	perhaps	I	do	this	diagnostic	for	her.”

“Good	idea,”	Lewis	said.	“And	how's	our	course?”

“Al	is	wel,”	Vogel	said.	“No	adjustments	necessary.	We	are	stil	on	track	to
planned	trajectory	within	4	meters.”

“Keep	me	posted	if	anything	changes.”

“Ja,	Commander.”

Floating	to	the	other	side	of	the	core,	Lewis	took	the	other	ladder	out,	again
gaining	gravity	as	she	went	“down”.	She	made	her	way	to

the	Airlock	2	ready	room.

Beck	held	a	coil	of	metal	wire	in	one	hand	and	a	pair	of	work	gloves	in	the	other.
“Heya,	Commander.	What's	up?”

“I'd	like	to	know	your	plan	for	recovering	Mark.”

“Easy	enough	if	the	intercept	is	good,”	Beck	said.	“I	just	finished	attaching	al	the
tethers	we	have	into	one	long	line.	It's	214	meters	long.	I'l	have	the	MMU	pack
on,	so	moving	around	wil	be	easy.	I	can	get	going	up	to	around	10	meters	per
second	safely.	Any	more	and

I	risk	breaking	the	tether	if	I	can't	stop	in	time.”

“How	fast	a	relative	velocity	can	you	handle,	you	think?”

“You	mean	once	I	get	to	Mark?	I	can	grab	the	MAV	easily	at	5	meters	per
second.	10	meters	per	second	is	kind	of	like	jumping	on	to

a	moving	train.	Anything	more	than	that	and	I	might	miss.”

“So,	including	the	MMU	safe	speed,	we	need	to	get	within	20	meters	per	second
of	his	velocity.”

“And	the	intercept	has	to	be	within	214	meters,”	Beck	said.	“Pretty	narrow
margin	of	error.”

“We've	got	a	lot	of	leeway,”	Lewis	said.	“The	launch	wil	be	52	minutes	before
the	intercept	and	it	takes	12	minutes.	As	soon	as

Mark's	S2	engine	cuts	out	we'l	know	our	intercept	point	and	velocity.	If	we	don't
like	it,	we'l	have	40	minutes	to	correct.	Our	engine's	2

milimeters	per	second	may	not	seem	like	much,	but	in	40	minutes	it	can	move	us
up	to	5.7	kilometers.”

“Good,”	Beck	said.	“And	214	meters	isn't	a	hard	limit,	per	se.”

“Yes	it	is,”	Lewis	corrected.

“Nah,”	Beck	said.	“I	know	I'm	not	supposed	to	go	untethered,	but	without	my
leash	I	could	get	way	out	there-”

“Not	an	option.”	Lewis	said.

“But	we	could	double	or	even	triple	our	safe	intercept	range-”

“We're	done	talking	about	this.”	Lewis	said	sternly.

“Aye,	Commander.”

There	aren't	many	people	who	can	say	they've	vandalized	a	three	bilion	dolar
spacecraft.	But	I'm	one	of	them.

I've	been	puling	critical	hardware	out	of	the	MAV	left	and	right.	It's	nice	to	know
that	my	launch	to	orbit	won't	have	any	pesky	back-

up	systems	weighing	me	down.

First	thing	I	did	was	remove	the	smal	stuff.	Then	came	the	things	I	could
disassemble.	Like	the	crew	seats,	several	of	the	back-up

systems,	and	the	control	panels.

I'm	not	improvising	anything.	I'm	folowing	a	script	sent	by	NASA,	which	was
set	up	to	make	things	as	easy	as	possible.	Sometimes	I

miss	the	days	when	I	made	al	the	decisions	myself.	Then	I	shake	it	off	and
remember	I'm	infinitely	better	with	a	bunch	of	geniuses	deciding	what	I	do	than
making	shit	up	as	I	go	along.

Periodicaly,	I	suit	up,	crawl	into	the	airlock	with	as	much	junk	as	I	can	fit,	and
dump	it	outside.	The	area	around	the	MAV	looks	like

the	set	of	Sanford	and	Son.

I	learned	about	Sanford	and	Son	from	Lewis's	colection.	Seriously,	that	woman
needs	to	see	someone	about	her	70's	problem.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	529

I'm	turning	my	pee	in	to	rocket	fuel.	It's	easier	than	you'd	think.

Urine	is	mostly	water.	Separating	hydrogen	and	oxygen	only	requires	a	couple	of
electrodes	and	some	current.	The	problem	is

colecting	the	hydrogen.	I	don't	have	any	equipment	for	puling	hydrogen	out	of
the	air.	The	Atmospheric	Regulator	doesn't	even	know	how.

The	last	time	I	had	to	get	hydrogen	out	of	the	air	(back	when	I	turned	the	Hab	in
to	a	bomb)	I	burned	it	to	turn	it	in	to	water.	Obviously	that	would	be	counter-
productive.

But	NASA	thought	everything	through	and	gave	me	a	process.	First,	I
disconnected	the	rover	and	trailer	from	each	other.	Then,	while

wearing	my	EVA	suit,	I	depressurized	the	trailer	and	back-filed	it	with	pure
oxygen	at	one	fourth	of	an	atmosphere.	Then	I	opened	a

plastic	box	ful	of	urine	and	put	a	couple	of	electrodes	in.	That's	why	I	needed	the
atmosphere.	Without	it,	the	urine	would	just	boil

immediately	and	I'd	be	hanging	around	in	an	piss-based	atmosphere.

The	electrolysis	separated	the	hydrogen	and	oxygen	from	each	other.	Over	time,
it	reduced	the	urine	to	a	realy	gross	sludge	as	it	puled

the	water	out.	Now	the	trailer	was	ful	of	even	more	oxygen	and	also	hydrogen.
Pretty	dangerous,	actualy.

Then	I	fired	up	the	Atmospheric	Regulator.	It	doesn't	even	recognize	hydrogen,
but	it	knows	how	to	yank	oxygen	out	of	the	air.	I	broke

al	the	safeties	and	set	it	to	pul	100%	of	the	oxygen	out.	After	it	was	done,	al	that
was	left	was	hydrogen.	That's	why	I	started	out	with	an	atmosphere	of	pure
oxygen.	So	the	regulator	could	separate	it	later.

Then	I	opened	the	inner	airlock	door	and	had	it	evacuate	the	trailer.	It	pumped	al
the	air	in	to	the	airlock's	holding	tank.	And	there	you	have	it,	a	tank	of	pure
hydrogen.

The	final	step	was	to	take	the	airlock's	holding	tank	to	the	MAV	and	transfer	the
contents	to	the	MAV's	hydrogen	tanks.	I've	said	this

many	times	before	but:	Hurray	for	standardized	valve	systems!

Once	I	fed	it	the	hydrogen,	I	fired	up	the	fuel	plant	and	it	got	to	work	making	the
additional	fuel	I'd	need.

I'l	need	to	go	through	this	process	several	more	times	as	the	launch	date
approaches.	I	could	have	done	this	al	at	once,	but	NASA

doesn't	want	me	to	run	low	on	water	until	we're	close	to	launch.	They'd	rather	I
electrolyze	urine	over	time	because	I've	already	“used”	that	water.

If	I	survive	this,	I'l	tel	people	I	pissed	my	way	in	to	orbit.

[19:22]JOHANSSEN:	Hello,	Mark.

[19:23]MAV:	Johanssen!?	Holy	crap!	They	finally	letting	you	talk	to	me
directly?

[19:24]JOHANSSEN:	Yes,	NASA	gave	the	OK	for	direct	communication	an
hour	ago.

We're	only	35	light-seconds	apart,	so	we	can	talk	in	near-realtime.	I	just	set	up

the	system	and	I'm	testing	it	out.

[19:24]MAV:	What	took	them	so	long	to	let	us	talk?

[19:25]JOHANSSEN:	The	psych	team	was	worried	about	personality	conflicts.

[19:25]MAV:	What?	Just	cause	you	guys	abandoned	me	on	a	godforsaken	planet
with

no	chance	of	survival?

[19:26]JOHANSSEN:	Funny.	Don't	make	that	kind	of	joke	with	Lewis.

[19:27]MAV:	Roger.	So	uh...	thanks	for	coming	back	to	get	me.

[19:27]JOHANSSEN:	It's	the	least	we	could	do.	How	is	the	MAV	retrofit	going?

[19:28]MAV:	So	far,	so	good.	NASA	put	a	lot	of	thought	into	the	procedures.
They

work.	That's	not	to	say	they're	easy.	I	spent	the	last	3	days	removing	Hull	Panel

19	and	the	front	window.	Even	in	Mars-G	they're	heavy	motherfuckers.

[19:29]JOHANSSEN:	When	we	pick	you	up,	I	will	make	wild,	passionate	love
to	you.

Prepare	your	body.

[19:29]JOHANSSEN:	I	didn't	type	that!	That	was	Martinez!	I	stepped	away
from	the

console	for	like	10	seconds!

[19:29]MAV:	I've	really	missed	you	guys.

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	543

I'm...	done?

I	think	I'm	done.

I	did	everything	on	the	list.	The	MAV	is	ready	to	fly.	And	in	6	sols,	that's	just
what	it'l	do.	I	hope.

It	might	not	launch	at	al.	I	did	remove	an	engine,	after	al.	I	could	have	fucked	up
al	sorts	of	things	during	that	process.	And	there's	no	way	to	test	the	ascent	stage.
Once	you	light	it,	it's	lit.

Everything	else,	however,	wil	go	through	tests	from	now	until	launch.	Some
done	by	me,	some	done	remotely	by	NASA.	They're	not

teling	me	the	failure	odds,	but	I'm	guessing	they're	the	highest	in	history.	Yuri
Gagarin	had	a	much	more	reliable	and	safe	ship	than	I	do.

And	Soviet	ships	were	fucking	deathtraps.

“Al	right,”	Lewis	said,	“tomorrow's	the	big	day.”

The	crew	floated	in	the	Rec.	They	had	halted	the	rotation	of	the	ship	in
preparation	for	the	upcoming	operation.

“I'm	ready,”	Martinez	said.	“Johanssen	threw	everything	she	could	at	me.	I	got	al
scenarios	to	orbit.”

“Everything	other	than	catastrophic	failures,”	Johanssen	corrected.

“Wel	yeah,”	Martinez	said.	“Kind	of	pointless	to	simulate	an	ascent	explosion.
Nothing	we	can	do.”

“Vogel,”	Lewis	said,	“How's	our	course.”

“It	is	perfect,”	Vogel	said.	“We	are	within	one	meter	of	projected	path	and	two
centimeters	per	second	of	projected	velocity.”

“Good,”	she	said.	“Beck,	how	about	you?”

“Everything's	al	set	up,	Commander,”	Beck	said.	“I	linked	al	the	tethers	I	could
find	and	spooled	them	up	in	Airlock	2.	My	suit	and

MMU	are	prepped	and	ready.”

“Ok,”	Lewis	said.	“The	battle	plan	is	pretty	obvious.	Martinez	wil	fly	the	MAV,
Johanssen	wil	sysop	the	ascent.	Beck	and	Vogel,	I

want	you	in	Airlock	2	with	the	outer	door	open	before	the	MAV	even	launches.
You'l	have	to	wait	52	minutes,	but	I	don't	want	to	risk	any	technical	glitches	with
the	airlock	or	your	suits.	Once	we	reach	intercept,	it'l	be	Beck's	job	to	get
Watney.”

“He	might	be	in	bad	shape	when	I	get	him,”	Beck	said.	“The	stripped-down
MAV	wil	get	up	to	12	g's	during	the	launch.	He	could	be

unconscious	and	may	even	have	internal	bleeding.”

“Just	as	wel	you're	our	doctor,”	Lewis	said.	“Vogel,	if	al	goes	according	to	plan,
you're	puling	Beck	and	Watney	back	aboard	with

the	tether.	If	things	go	wrong,	you're	Beck's	backup.”

“Ja,”	Vogel	said.

“I	wish	there	was	more	we	could	do	right	now,”	Lewis	said.	“But	al	we	have	left
is	the	wait.	Your	work	schedules	are	cleared.	Al

scientific	experiments	are	suspended.	Sleep	if	you	can,	run	diagnostics	on	your
equipment	if	you	can't.”

“We'l	get	him,	Commander,”	Martinez	said.	“24	hours	from	now,	Mark	Watney
wil	be	right	here	in	this	room.”

“Let's	hope	so,	Major.”	Lewis	said.	“Dismissed.”

“Final	checks	for	this	shift	are	complete,”	Mitch	said	in	to	his	headset.
“Timekeeper.”

“Go,	flight,”	said	the	Timekeeper.

“Time	until	MAV	launch?”

“16	hours,	9	minutes,	40	seconds...	mark.”

“Copy	that.	Al	stations:	Flight	Director	shift	change.”	He	took	his	headset	off
and	rubbed	his	eyes.

Brendan	Hutch	took	the	headset	from	him	and	put	it	on.	“Al	stations,	Flight
Director	is	now	Brendan	Hutch.”

“Cal	me	if	anything	happens,”	Mitch	said.	“If	not,	I'l	see	you	tomorrow.”

“Get	some	sleep,	boss,”	Brendan	said.

Venkat	watched	from	the	observation	booth.	“Why	ask	the	Timekeeper?”	he
mumbled.	“It's	on	the	huge	mission	clock	in	the	center

screen.”

“He's	nervous,”	Annie	said.	“You	don't	often	see	it,	but	that's	what	Mitch
Henderson	looks	like	when	he's	nervous.	He	double	and

triple	checks	everything.”

“Fair	enough,”	Venkat	said.

“They're	camping	out	on	the	lawn,	by	the	way,”	Annie	said.	“Reporters	from	al
over	the	world.	Our	press	rooms	just	don't	have

enough	space.”

“The	media	loves	a	drama,”	he	sighed.	“It'l	be	over	tomorrow,	one	way	or
another.”

“What's	our	role	in	al	this?”	Annie	said.	“If	something	goes	wrong,	what	can
Mission	Control	do?”

“Nothing,”	Venkat	said.	“Not	a	damned	thing.”

“Nothing?”

“It's	al	happening	12	light-minutes	away.	That	means	it	takes	24	minutes	for
them	to	get	the	answer	to	any	question	they	ask.	The

whole	launch	is	12	minutes	long.	They're	on	their	own.”

“Oh,”	Annie	said.	“So	we're	just	observers	in	al	this?”

“Yes,”	Venkat	said.	“Sucks,	doesn't	it?”

LOG	ENTRY:	SOL	549

I'd	be	lying	if	I	said	I	wasn't	shitting	myself.	In	4	hours,	I'm	going	to	ride	a	giant
explosion	into	orbit.	This	is	something	I've	done	a	few	times	before,	but	never
with	a	jury-rigged	mess	like	this.

Right	now,	I'm	sitting	in	the	MAV.	I'm	suited	up	because	there's	a	big	hole	in	the
front	of	the	ship	where	the	window	and	part	of	the	hul	used	to	be.	I'm	“awaiting

launch	instructions.”	Realy,	I'm	just	awaiting	launch.	I	don't	have	any	part	in
this.	I'm	just	going	to	sit	in	the	acceleration	couch	and	hope	for	the	best.

Last	night,	I	ate	my	final	meal	pack.	It's	the	first	good	meal	I've	had	in	weeks.
I'm	leaving	41	potatoes	behind.	That's	how	close	I	came	to	starvation.

I	carefuly	colected	samples	from	my	entire	journey.	But	I	can't	bring	any	of	them
with	me.	So	I	put	them	in	a	container	a	few	hundred

meters	from	here.	Maybe	some	day	they'l	send	a	probe	to	colect	them.	May	as
wel	make	them	easy	to	pick	up.

This	is	it.	There's	nothing	after	this.	There	isn't	even	an	abort	procedure.	Why
make	one?	We	can't	delay	the	launch.	Hermes	can't	stop

and	wait.	No	matter	what,	we're	launching	on	schedule.

I	face	the	very	real	possibility	that	I'l	die	today.	Can't	say	I	like	it.	It	wouldn't	be
so	bad	if	the	MAV	blew	up.	I	wouldn't	know	what	hit	me.

If	I	miss	the	intercept	I'l	just	float	around	in	space	until	I	run	out	of	air.	I	have	a
contingency	plan	for	that.	I'l	drop	the	oxygen	mixture	to	zero	and	breathe	pure
nitrogen	until	I	suffocate.	It	wouldn't	feel	bad.	The	lungs	don't	have	the	ability	to
sense	lack	of	oxygen.	I'd	just	get	tired,	fal	asleep,	then	die.

I've	had	my	last	Martian	potato.	I've	slept	in	the	rover	for	the	last	time.	I've	had
my	last	EVA	on	the	surface.	I'm	leaving	Mars	today,	one	way	or	another.

About	fucking	time.

Chapter	26

They	gathered.

Everywhere	on	Earth,	they	gathered.

From	Trafalgar	Square	to	Tienanmen	Square	to	Times	Square,	they	watched	on
giant	screens.	In	offices	they	huddled	around	computer

monitors.	In	bars,	they	stared	silently	at	the	TV	in	the	corner.	In	homes	they	sat
breathlessly	on	their	couches,	their	eyes	glued	to	the	story	playing	out.

In	Chicago,	a	couple	clutched	each	other's	hands	as	they	watched.	The	man	held
his	wife	gently	as	she	rocked	back	and	forth	out	of

sheer	terror.	The	NASA	representative	knew	not	to	disturb	them,	but	stood	ready
to	answer	any	questions	should	they	ask.

“Fuel	Pressure	green,”	Johanssen's	voice	said	from	a	bilion	televisions.	“Engine
alignment	perfect.	Communications	5	by	5.	We	are

ready	for	preflight	checklist,	Commander.”

“Copy,”	came	Lewis's	voice.	“CAPCOM”

“Go,”	Johanssen	responded.

“Guidance.”

“Go,”	Johanssen	said	again.

“Remote	Command.”

“Go,”	said	Martinez.

“Pilot.”

“Go,”	said	Watney	from	the	MAV.

A	mild	cheer	coruscated	through	the	crowds	worldwide.

Mitch	sat	at	his	station	in	mission	control.	They	monitored	everything	and	were
ready	to	help	in	any	way	the	could.	The	communication

latency	between	Hermes	and	Earth	made	any	such	need	highly	unlikely.

“Telemetry,”	Lewis's	voice	said	over	the	speakers.

“Go,”	Johanssen	responded.

“Recovery,”	she	continued.

“Go,”	said	Beck	from	the	airlock.

“Secondary	Recovery.”

“Go,”	said	Vogel	from	beside	Beck.

“Mission	control,	this	is	Hermes	Actual,”	Lewis	reported.	“We	are	go	for	launch
and	wil	proceed	on	schedule.	We	are	T	minus	four

minutes,	10	seconds	to	launch...	mark.”

“Did	you	get	that,	Timekeeper?”	Mitch	said.

“Affirmative,	flight,”	came	the	response.	“Our	clocks	are	synched	with	theirs.”

“Not	that	we	can	do	anything,”	Mitch	mumbled,	“But	at	least	we'l	know	what's
supposedly	happening.”

“About	four	minutes,	Mark,”	Lewis	said	into	her	mic.	“How	you	doing	down
there?”

“Eager	to	get	up	there,	Commander,”	Watney	responded.

“We're	going	to	make	that	happen,”	Lewis	said.	“Remember,	you'l	be	puling
some	pretty	heavy	G's.	It's	ok	to	pass	out.	You're	in

Martinez's	hands.”

“Tel	that	asshole	no	barrel-rols.”

“Copy	that,	MAV,”	Lewis	said.

“Four	more	minutes,”	Martinez	said,	cracking	his	knuckles.	“You	ready	for	some
flying,	Beth?”

“Yeah,”	Johanssen	said.	“It'l	be	strange	to	sysop	a	launch	and	stay	in	zero-g	the
whole	time.”

“I	hadn't	thought	of	it	that	way,”	Martinez	said,	“but	yeah.	I'm	not	going	to	be
squashed	against	the	back	my	seat.	Weird.”

Beck	floated	in	the	airlock,	tethered	to	a	wal-mounted	spool.	Vogel	stood	beside
him,	his	boots	clamped	to	the	floor.	Both	stared

through	the	open	outer	door	to	the	red	planet	below.

“Didn't	think	I'd	be	back	here	again,”	Beck	said.

“Yes,”	Vogel	said.	“We	are	the	first.”

“First	what?”

“We	are	the	first	to	visit	Mars	twice.”

“Oh	yeah.	Even	Watney	can't	say	that.”

“He	cannot.”

They	looked	at	Mars	in	silence	for	a	while.

“Vogel,”	Beck	said.

“Ja.”

“If	I	can't	reach	Mark,	I	want	you	to	release	my	tether.”

“Doctor	Beck,”	Vogel	said,	“The	Commander	has	said	no	to	this.”

“I	know	what	the	Commander	said,	but	if	I	need	a	few	more	meters,	I	want	you

to	cut	me	loose.	I	have	an	MMU,	I	can	get	back

without	a	tether.”

“I	wil	not	do	this,	Doctor	Beck.”

“It's	my	own	life	at	risk,	and	I	say	it's	ok.”

“You	are	not	the	Commander.”

Beck	scowled	at	Vogel,	but	with	their	reflective	visors	down,	the	effect	was	lost.

“Fine,”	Beck	said.	“But	I	bet	you'l	change	your	mind	if	push	comes	to	shove.”

Vogel	did	not	respond.

“T-minus	10,”	said	Johanssen,	“9...8...”

“Main	engines	start,”	said	Martinez.

“7...6...5...mooring	clamps	released...”

“About	5	seconds,	Watney,”	Lewis	said	to	her	headset.	“Hang	on.”

“See	you	in	a	few,	Commander,”	Watney	radioed	back.

“4...3...2...”

Watney	lay	in	the	acceleration	couch	as	the	MAV	rumbled	in	anticipation	of
liftoff.

“Hmm,”	he	said	to	nobody.	“I	wonder	how	much	longer-”

The	MAV	launched	with	incredible	force.	More	than	any	manned	ship	had
accelerated	in	the	history	of	space	travel.	Watney	was

shoved	in	to	his	couch	so	hard	he	couldn't	even	grunt.

Having	anticipated	this,	he	had	placed	a	folded	up	shirt	behind	his	head	in	the
helmet.	As	his	head	pressed	firmly	in	to	the	makeshift

cushion,	the	edges	of	his	vision	became	blurry.	He	could	neither	breathe	nor
move.

Directly	in	his	field	of	view,	the	Hab	canvas	patch	flapped	violently	as	the	ship
exponentialy	gained	speed.	Concentration	became

difficult,	but	something	in	the	back	of	his	mind	told	him	that	was	bad.

“Velocity	741	meters	per	second,”	Johanssen	quickly	caled	out.	“Altitude	1350
meters.”

“Copy,”	Martinez	said.

“That's	low,”	Lewis	said.	“Too	low.”

“I	know,”	Martinez	said.	“It's	sluggish;	fighting	me.	What	the	fuck	is	going	on?”

“Velocity	850,	altitude	1843,”	Johanssen	said.

“I'm	not	getting	the	power	I	need!”	Martinez	said.

“Engine	power	at	100%,”	Johanssen	said.

“I'm	teling	you	it's	sluggish,”	Martinez	insisted.

“Watney,”	Lewis	said	to	her	headset.	“Watney,	do	you	read?	Can	you	report?”

Watney	heard	Lewis's	voice	in	the	distance.	Like	someone	talking	to	him
through	a	long	tunnel.	He	vaguely	wondered	what	she

wanted.	His	attention	was	briefly	drawn	to	the	fluttering	canvas	ahead	of	him.	A
rip	had	appeared	and	was	rapidly	widening.

But	then	he	was	distracted	by	a	bolt	in	one	of	the	bulkheads.	It	only	had	five
sides.	He	wondered	why	NASA	decided	that	bolt	needed

five	sides	instead	of	six.	It	would	require	a	special	wrench	to	tighten	or	loosen.

The	canvas	tore	even	further,	the	tattered	material	flapping	wildly.	Through	the
opening,	Watney	saw	red	sky	stretching	out	infinitely

ahead.	“That's	nice,”	he	thought.

As	the	MAV	flew	higher,	the	atmosphere	grew	thinner.	Soon,	the	canvas	stopped
fluttering	and	simply	stretched	toward	Mark.	The

sky	shifted	from	red	to	black.

“That's	nice,	too,”	Mark	thought.

As	consciousness	slipped	away,	he	wondered	where	he	could	get	a	cool	5-sided
bolt	like	that.

“I'm	getting	more	response	now,”	Martinez	said.

“Back	on	track	with	ful	acceleration,”	Johanssen	said.	“Must	have	been	drag.
MAV's	out	of	the	atmosphere	now.”

“It	was	like	flying	a	cow,”	Martinez	grumbled,	his	hands	racing	over	his
controls.

“Can	you	get	him	up?”	Lewis	asked.

“He'l	get	to	orbit,”	Johanssen	said,	“but	the	intercept	course	may	be
compromised.”

“Get	him	up	first,”	Lewis	said.	“Then	we'l	worry	about	intercept.”

“Copy.	Main	engine	cut-off	in	15	seconds.”

“Much	smoother	now,”	Martinez	said.	“It's	not	fighting	me	at	al	anymore.”

“Wel	below	target	altitude,”	Johanssen	said.	“Velocity	is	good.”

“How	far	below?”	Lewis	said.

“Can't	say	for	sure,”	Johanssen	said.	“Al	I	have	is	accelerometer	data.	We'l	need
radar	pings	at	intervals	to	work	out	his	true	final

orbit.”

“Back	to	automatic	guidance,”	Martinez	said.

“Main	shutdown	in	4,”	Johanssen	said	“3...	2...	1...	Shutdown.”

“Confirm	shutdown,”	Martinez	said.

“Watney,	you	there?”	Lewis	said.	“Watney?	Watney,	do	you	read?”

“Probably	passed	out,	Commander,”	Beck	said	over	the	radio.	“He	puled	12	G's
on	the	ascent.	Give	him	a	few	minutes.”

“Copy,”	Lewis	said.	“Johanssen,	got	his	orbit	yet?”

“I	have	interval	pings.	Working	out	our	intercept	range	and	velocity...”

Martinez	and	Lewis	stared	intensely	at	Johanssen	as	she	brought	up	the	intercept
calculation	software.	Normaly,	orbits	would	be

worked	out	by	Vogel,	but	he	was	otherwise	engaged.	Johanssen	was	his	backup
for	orbital	dynamics.

“Intercept	velocity	wil	be	11	meters	per	second...”	she	began.

“I	can	make	that	work,”	Beck	said	over	the	radio.

“Distance	at	intercept	wil	be-”	She	stopped	and	choked.	Shakily,	she	continued.
“We'l	be	68	kilometers	apart.”	She	buried	her	face	in

her	hands.

“Did	she	say	68	kilometers!?”	Beck	said.	“Kilometers!?	”

“God	damn	it,”	Martinez	whispered.

“Keep	it	together,”	Lewis	said.	“Work	the	problem.	Martinez,	is	there	any	juice
in	the	MAV?”

“Negative,	Commander,”	Martinez	responded.	“They	ditched	the	OMS	system	to
lighten	the	launch	weight.”

“Then	we'l	have	to	go	to	him.	Johanssen,	time	to	intercept?”

“39	minutes,	12	seconds,”	Johanssen	said,	trying	not	to	quaver.

“Vogel,”	Lewis	continued,	“how	far	can	we	deflect	in	39	minutes	with	the	ion
engines?”

“Perhaps	5	kilometers,”	he	radioed.

“Not	enough,”	Lewis	said.	“Martinez,	what	if	we	point	our	attitude	thrusters	al
the	same	direction?”

“Depends	on	how	much	fuel	we	want	to	save	for	attitude	adjustments	on	the	trip
home.”

“How	much	do	you	need?”

“I	could	get	by	with	maybe	20	percent	of	what's	left.”

“Al	right,	if	you	used	the	other	80	percent-”

“Checking,”	Martinez	said,	running	the	numbers	on	his	console.	“We'd	get	a
delta-v	of	31	meters	per	second.”

“Johanssen,”	Lewis	said.	“Math.”

“In	39	minutes	we'd	deflect...”	Johanssen	quickly	typed,	“72	kilometers!”

“There	we	go,”	Lewis	said.	“How	much	fuel-”

“Use	75.5	percent	of	remaining	attitude	adjust	fuel,”	Johanssen	said.	“That'l
bring	the	intercept	range	to	zero.”

“Do	it,”	Lewis	said.

“Aye,	Commander.”	Martinez	said.

“Hold	on,”	Johanssen	said.	“That'l	get	the	intercept	range	to	zero,	but	the
intercept	velocity	wil	be	42	meters	per	second.”

“Then	we	have	39	minutes	to	figure	out	how	to	slow	down,”	Lewis	said.
“Martinez,	burn	the	jets.”

“Aye.”	Martinez	said.

“Whoa,”	Annie	said	to	Venkat.	“A	lot	of	shit	just	happened	realy	fast.	Explain.”

Venkat	strained	to	hear	to	speaker	over	the	murmur	of	the	VIPs	in	the
observation	booth.	Through	the	glass	he	saw	Mitch	throw	his

hands	up	in	frustration.

“The	launch	missed	badly,”	Venkat	said,	looking	past	Mitch	to	the	screens
beyond.	“The	intercept	distance	was	going	to	be	way	too

big.	So	they're	using	the	attitude	adjusters	to	close	the	gap.”

“What	do	attitude	adjusters	usualy	do?”

“They	rotate	the	ship.	They're	not	made	for	thrusting	it.	Hermes	doesn't	have
quick	reaction	engines.	Just	the	slow	steady	ion	engines.”

“So...	problem	solved?”	Annie	said	hopefuly.

“No,”	Venkat	said.	“They'l	get	to	him,	but	they'l	be	going	42	meters	per	second
when	they	get	there.”

“How	fast	is	that?”	Annie	asked.

“About	90	miles	per	hour,”	Venkat	said.	“There's	no	hope	of	Beck	grabbing
Watney	at	that	speed.”

“Can	they	use	the	attitude	adjusters	to	slow	down?”

“They	used	al	the	fuel	they	could	to	close	the	gap	in	time.	They	don't	have
enough	to	slow	down.”	Venkat	frowned.

“So	what	can	they	do?”

“I	don't	know,”	he	said.	“And	even	if	I	did,	I	couldn't	tel	them	in	time.”

“Wel	fuck,”	Annie	said.

“Yeah,”	Venkat	agreed.

“Watney,”	Lewis	said	“Do	you	read?”

“Watney?”	She	repeated.

“Commander,”	Beck	radioed.	“He's	wearing	a	surface	EVA	suit,	right?”

“Yeah.”

“It	should	have	a	bio-monitor,”	Beck	said.	“And	it'l	be	broadcasting.	It's	not	a
strong	signal;	it's	only	designed	to	go	a	couple	hundred	meters	to	the	rover	or
Hab.	But	maybe	we	can	pick	it	up.”

“Johanssen,”	Lewis	said.

“On	it,”	Johanssen	said.	“I	have	to	look	up	the	frequencies	in	the	tech	specs.
Gimme	a	second.”

“Martinez,”	Lewis	continued.	“Any	idea	how	to	slow	down?”

He	shook	his	head.	“I	got	nothin',	Commander.	We're	just	going	too	damn	fast.”

“Vogel?”

“The	ion	drive	is	simply	not	strong	enough,”	Vogel	replied.

“There's	got	to	be	something,”	Lewis	said.	“Something	we	can	do.	Anything.”

“Got	his	biomonitor	data,”	Johanssen	said.	“Pulse	58,	blood	pressure	98/61.”

“That's	not	bad,”	Beck	said.	“Lower	than	I'd	like	but	he's	been	in	Mars	gravity
for	18	months,	so	it's	expected.”

“Time	to	intercept?”	Lewis	asked.

“32	minutes,”	Johanssen	replied.

Blissful	unconsciousness	became	foggy	awareness	which	transitioned	into
painful	reality.	Watney	opened	his	eyes,	then	winced	at	the

pain	in	his	chest.

Little	remained	of	the	canvas.	Tatters	floated	along	the	edge	of	the	hole	it	once
covered.	This	granted	Watney	an	unobstructed	view	of

Mars	from	orbit.	The	great	red	planet's	horizon	stretched	out	seemingly	forever
as	the	wispy	atmosphere	gave	it	a	fuzzy	edge.	Only	18

people	in	history	had	personaly	seen	this	view.

“Fuck	you,”	he	said	to	the	planet	below.

Reaching	toward	the	controls	on	his	arm,	he	winced.	Trying	again,	more	slowly
this	time,	he	activated	his	radio.	“MAV	to	Hermes.”

“Watney!?”	Came	the	reply.

“Affirmative.	That	you,	Commander?”	Watney	said.

“Affirmative.	What's	your	status?”

“I'm	on	a	ship	with	no	control	panel,”	he	said.	“That's	as	much	as	I	can	tel	you.”

“How	do	you	feel?”

“My	chest	hurts.	I	think	I	broke	a	rib.	How	are	you?”

“We're	working	on	getting	you,”	Lewis	said.	“There	was	a	complication	in	the
launch.”

“Yeah,”	Watney	said,	looking	out	the	hole	in	the	ship.	“The	canvas	didn't	hold.	I
think	it	ripped	early	in	the	ascent.”

“That's	consistent	with	what	we	saw	during	the	launch.”

“How	bad	is	it,	Commander?”	He	asked.

“We	were	able	to	correct	the	intercept	range	with	Hermes's	attitude	thrusters.	But
there's	a	problem	with	the	intercept	velocity.”

“How	big	a	problem.”

“42	meters	per	second.”

“Wel	shit.”

“Hey,	at	least	he's	ok	for	the	moment,”	Martinez	said.

“Beck,”	Lewis	said.	“I'm	coming	around	to	your	way	of	thinking.	How	fast	can
you	get	going	if	you're	untethered?”

“Sorry,	Commander,”	Beck	said.	“I	already	ran	the	numbers.	At	best	I	could	get
25	meters	per	second.	Even	if	I	could	get	to	42,	I'd

need	another	42	to	match	Hermes	when	I	came	back.”

“Copy,”	Lewis	said.

“Hey,”	Watney	said	over	the	radio,	“I've	got	an	idea.”

“Of	course	you	do,”	Lewis	said.	“What	do	you	got?”

“I	could	find	something	sharp	in	here	and	poke	a	hole	in	the	glove	of	my	EVA
suit.	I	could	use	the	escaping	air	as	a	thruster	and	fly	my	way	to	you.	The	source
of	thrust	would	be	on	my	arm,	so	I'd	be	able	to	direct	it	pretty	easily.”

“How	does	he	come	up	with	this	shit?”	Martinez	interjected.

“Hmm,”	Lewis	said.	“Could	you	get	42	meters	per	second	that	way?”

“No	idea,”	Watney	said.

“I	can't	see	you	having	any	control	if	you	did	that,”	Lewis	said.	“You'd	be
eyebaling	the	intercept	and	using	a	thrust	vector	you	can

barely	control.”

“I	admit	it's	fataly	dangerous,”	Watney	said.	“But	consider	this:	I'd	get	to	fly
around	like	Iron	Man.”

“We'l	keep	working	on	ideas,”	Lewis	said.

“Iron	Man,	Commander.	Iron	Man.	”

“Standby,”	Lewis	said.

She	furrowed	her	brow.	“Hmm...	Maybe	it's	not	such	a	bad	idea...”

“You	kidding,	Commander?”	Martinez	said.	“It's	a	terrible	idea.	He'd	shoot	off	in
to	space-”

“Not	the	whole	idea,	but	part	of	it,”	she	said.	“Using	atmosphere	as	thrust.
Martinez,	get	Vogel's	station	up	and	running.”

“Ok,”	Martinez	said,	typing	at	his	keyboard.	The	screen	changed	to	Vogel's
workstation.	He	quickly	changed	the	language	from

German	to	English.	“It's	up.	What	do	you	need?”

“Vogel's	got	software	for	calculating	course	offsets	caused	by	hul	breaches,
right?”

“Yeah,”	Martinez	said.	“It	estimates	course	corrections	needed	in	the	event	of-”

“Yeah,	yeah,”	Lewis	said.	“Fire	it	up.	I	want	to	know	what	happens	if	we	blow
the	VAL.”

Johanssen	and	Martinez	looked	at	each	other.

“Um.	Yes,	Commander,”	Martinez	said.

“The	Vehicular	Airlock?”	Johanssen	said.	“You	want	to...	open	it?”

“Plenty	of	air	in	the	ship,”	Lewis	said.	“It'd	give	us	a	good	kick.”

“Ye-es...”	Martinez	said	as	he	brought	up	the	software.	“And	it	might	blow	the
nose	of	the	ship	off	in	the	process.”

“Also,	al	the	air	would	leave,”	Johanssen	felt	compeled	to	add.

“We'l	seal	the	bridge	and	reactor	room.	We	can	let	everywhere	else	go	vacuo,	but
we	don't	want	explosive	decompression	in	here	or

near	the	reactor.”

Martinez	entered	the	scenario	in	to	the	software.	“I	think	we'l	just	have	the	same
problem	as	Watney,	but	on	a	larger	scale.	We	can't

direct	that	thrust.”

“We	don't	have	to,”	Lewis	said.	“The	VAL	is	in	the	nose.	Escaping	air	would
make	a	thrust	vector	through	our	center	of	mass.	We	just

need	to	point	the	ship	directly	away	from	where	we	want	to	go.”

“Ok	I	have	the	numbers,”	Martinez	said.	“A	breach	at	the	VAL,	with	the	bridge
and	reactor	room	sealed	off,	would	accelerate	us	29

meters	per	second.”

“We'd	have	a	relative	velocity	of	13	meters	per	second	afterward,”	Johanssen
supplied.

“Beck,”	Lewis	radioed,	“Have	you	been	hearing	al	this?”

“Affirmative,	Commander,”	Beck	said.	“

“Can	you	do	13	meters	per	second?”

“It'l	be	risky,”	Beck	replied,	“13	to	match	the	MAV	then	another	13	to	match
Hermes.	But	it's	a	hel	of	a	lot	better	than	42.”

“Johanssen,”	Lewis	said.	“time	to	intercept?”

“18	minutes,	Commander.”

“What	kind	of	jolt	wil	we	feel	with	that	breach?”	Lewis	asked	to	Martinez.

“The	air	wil	take	4	seconds	to	evacuate,”	he	said.	“We'l	feel	a	little	less	than	one
g.”

“Watney,”	she	said	to	her	headset,	“We	have	a	plan.”

“Yay!	A	plan!”	Watney	replied.

“Houston,”	Lewis's	voice	rang	through	Mission	Control,	“be	advised	we	are
going	to	deliberately	breach	the	VAL	to	produce	thrust.”

“What?”	Mitch	said.	“What!?”	He	yeled.

“Oh...	my	god,”	Venkat	said	in	the	observation	room.

“Fuck	me	raw,”	Annie	said,	getting	up.	“I	better	get	to	the	press	room.	Any
parting	knowledge	before	I	go?”

“They're	going	to	breach	the	ship,”	Venkat	said,	stil	dumbfounded.	“They're
going	to	deliberately	breach	the	ship.	Oh	my	god...”

“Got	it,”	Annie	said,	jogging	to	the	door.

“How	wil	we	open	the	airlock	doors?”	Martinez	asked.	“There's	no	way	to	open
them	remotely,	and	if	anyone's	nearby	when	it

blows-”

“Right,”	Lewis	said.	“We	can	open	one	door	with	the	other	shut,	but	how	do	we
open	the	other?”

She	thought	for	a	moment.	“Vogel,”	she	radioed.	“I	need	you	to	come	back	in
and	make	a	bomb.”

“Um.	Again,	please,	Commander?”	Vogel	replied.

“A	bomb,”	Lewis	confirmed.	“You're	a	chemist.	Can	you	make	a	bomb	out	of
stuff	on	board?”

“Ja,”	Vogel	said.	“We	have	flammables	and	pure	oxygen.”

“Sounds	good.”	Lewis	said.

“It	is	of	course	dangerous	to	set	off	an	explosive	device	on	a	spacecraft,”	Vogel
said	pragmaticaly.

“So	make	it	smal,”	Lewis	said.	“It	just	needs	to	poke	a	hole	in	the	inner	airlock
door.	Any	hole	wil	do.	If	it	blows	the	door	off	that's	fine.	If	it	doesn't,	the	air	wil
get	out	slower,	but	for	longer.	The	momentum	change	is	the	same	and	we'l	get
the	acceleration	we	need.”

“Pressurizing	Airlock-2,”	Vogel	reported.	“How	wil	we	activate	this	bomb?”

“Johanssen?”	Lewis	said.

“Uh...”	Johanssen	said.	She	picked	up	her	headset	and	quickly	put	it	on.	“Vogel,

can	you	run	wires	in	to	it?”

“Ja,”	Vogel	said.	“I	wil	use	threaded	stopper	with	a	smal	hole	for	the	wires.	It	wil
have	little	effect	on	the	seal.”

“We	could	run	the	wire	to	lighting	panel	41,”	Johanssen	said.	“It's	next	to	the
airlock,	and	I	can	turn	it	on	and	off	from	here.”

“There's	our	remote	trigger,”	Lewis	said.	“Johanssen	go	set	up	the	lighting	panel.
Vogel,	get	in	here	and	make	the	bomb.	Martinez,	go

close	and	seal	the	doors	to	the	reactor	room.”

“Yes	Commander,”	Johanssen	said,	kicking	off	her	seat	toward	the	halway.

“Commander,”	Martinez	said,	pausing	at	the	exit,	“You	want	me	to	bring	back
some	space	suits?”

“No	point,”	Lewis	said.	“If	the	seal	on	the	bridge	doesn't	hold	we'l	get	sucked
out	at	close	to	the	speed	of	sound.	We'l	be	jely	with	or	without	suits	on.”

“Roger,	Commander.”

“Are	you	back	in	yet,	Vogel?”	Lewis	asked.

“I	am	just	re-entering	now,	Commander.”

“Beck,”	Lewis	said	to	her	headset.	“I'l	need	you	back	in,	too.	But	don't	take	your
suit	off.”

“Ok,”	Beck	said.	“Why?”

“We're	going	to	have	to	literaly	blow	up	one	of	the	doors,”	Lewis	explained.	“I'd
rather	we	kil	the	inner	one.	I	want	the	outer	door

unharmed	so	we	keep	our	smooth	aerobraking	shape.”

“Makes	sense.”	Beck	responded	as	he	floated	back	in	to	the	ship.

“One	problem,”	Lewis	said.	“I	want	the	outer	door	locked	in	the	fuly	open
position	with	the	mechanical	stopper	in	place	to	keep	it

from	being	trashed	by	the	decompress.”

“You	have	to	have	someone	in	the	airlock	to	do	that,”	Beck	said.	“And	you	can't
open	the	inner	door	if	the	outer	door	is	locked	open.”

“Right,”	Lewis	said.	“I	need	you	to	go	to	the	VAL,	depressurize,	and	lock	the
outer	door	open.	Then	you'l	need	to	crawl	along	the	hul

to	get	back	to	Airlock	2.”

“Copy,	Commander,”	Beck	said.	“There	are	latch	points	al	over	the	hul.	I'l	move
my	tether	along,	mountain	climber	style.”

“Get	to	it,”	Lewis	said.	“And	Vogel,	you're	in	a	hurry.	You	have	to	make	the
bomb,	set	it	up,	get	back	to	Airlock	2,	suit	up,

depressurize	it,	and	open	the	outer	door	so	Beck	can	get	in.”

“He's	taking	his	suit	off	right	now	and	can't	reply,”	Beck	reported,	“but	he	heard
the	order.”

“Watney,	how	you	doing?”	Lewis's	voice	said	in	his	ear.

“Fine	so	far,	Commander,”	Watney	replied.	“You	mentioned	a	plan?”

“Affirmative,”	she	said.	“We're	going	to	vent	atmosphere	to	get	thrust.”

“How?”

“We're	going	to	blow	a	hole	in	the	VAL.”

“What!?”	Watney	said.	“How!?”

“Vogel's	making	a	bomb.”

“I	knew	that	guy	was	a	mad	scientist!”	Watney	said.	“I	think	we	should	just	go
with	my	Iron	Man	idea.”

“That's	too	risky	and	you	know	it,”	she	replied.

“Thing	is,”	Watney	said,	“I'm	selfish.	I	want	the	memorials	back	home	to	be	just

for	me.	I	don't	want	the	rest	of	you	losers	in	them.	I

can't	let	you	guys	blow	the	VAL.”

“Oh,”	Lewis	said.	“Wel	if	you	won't	let	us	then-	wait...	wait	a	minute...	I'm
looking	at	my	shoulder	patch	and	it	turns	out	I'm	the	Commander.	Sit	tight.
We're	coming	to	get	you.”

“Smart-ass.”

Being	a	chemist,	Vogel	knew	how	to	make	a	bomb.	In	fact,	much	of	his	training
was	to	avoid	making	them	by	mistake.

The	ship	had	few	flammables	aboard,	due	to	the	fatal	danger	of	fire.	But	food,	by
its	very	nature,	contained	flammable	hydrocarbons.

Lacking	time	to	sit	down	and	do	the	math,	he	estimated.

Sugar	has	4000	food-calories	per	kilogram.	One	food-calorie	is	4184	Joules.
Sugar	in	zero-g	wil	float	and	the	grains	wil	separate,

maximizing	surface	area.	In	a	pure	oxygen	environment,	16.7	milion	Joules	wil
be	released	for	every	kilogram	of	sugar	used,	releasing	the	explosive	force	of	8
sticks	of	dynamite.	Such	is	the	nature	of	combustion	in	pure	oxygen.

Vogel	measured	the	sugar	carefuly.	He	poured	it	into	the	strongest	container	he
could	find,	a	thick	glass	beaker.	The	strength	of	the

container	was	as	important	as	the	explosive.	A	weak	container	would	simply
cause	a	firebal	without	much	concussive	force.	A	strong

container,	however,	would	contain	the	pressure	until	it	reached	trus	destructive
potential.

He	quickly	driled	a	hole	in	the	stopper,	then	stripped	a	section	of	wire.	He	ran
the	wire	through	the	hole.

“Sehr	gefährlich,”	he	mumbled	as	he	poured	liquid	oxygen	from	the	ship's
supply	in	to	the	container,	then	quickly	screwed	the	stopper

on.	In	just	a	few	minutes,	he	had	made	a	rudimentary	pipe	bomb.

“Sehr,	sehr,	gefährlich,”

He	floated	out	of	the	lab	and	made	his	way	toward	the	nose	of	the	ship.

Johanssen	worked	on	the	lighting	panel	as	Beck	floated	toward	the	airlock.

She	grabbed	his	arm.	“Be	careful	crawling	along	the	hul.”

He	turned	to	face	her.	“Be	careful	setting	up	the	bomb.”

She	kissed	his	faceplate	then	looked	away,	embarrassed.	“That	was	stupid.	Don't
tel	anyone	I	did	that.”

“Don't	tel	anyone	I	liked	it,”	Beck	smiled.

He	entered	the	airlock	and	sealed	the	inner	door.	After	depressurizing,	he	opened
the	outer	door	and	locked	it	in	place.	Grabbing	a

handrail	on	the	hul,	he	puled	himself	out.

Johanssen	watched	until	he	was	no	longer	in	view,	then	returned	to	the	lighting
panel.	She	had	deactivated	it	earlier	from	her

workstation.	Puling	a	length	of	the	cable	out	and	stripping	the	ends,	she	fiddled
with	a	rol	of	electrical	tape	until	Vogel	arrived.

He	showed	up	just	a	minute	later,	carefuly	floating	down	the	hal	with	the	bomb
held	in	both	hands.

“I	have	used	a	single	wire	for	igniting,”	he	explained.	“I	did	not	want	to	risk	two
wires	for	a	spark.	It	would	be	dangerous	to	us	if	we	had	static	while	setting	up.”

“How	do	we	set	it	off?”	Johanssen	said.

“The	wire	must	reach	a	high	temperature.	If	you	short	power	through	it,	that	wil
be	sufficient.”

“I'l	have	to	pin	the	breaker,”	Johanssen	said,	“but	it'l	work.”

She	twisted	the	lighting	wires	to	the	bomb's	and	taped	them	off.

“Excuse	me,”	Vogel	said.	“I	have	to	return	to	Airlock	2	to	let	Dr.	Beck	back	in.”

“Mm,”	Johanssen	said.

Martinez	floated	back	in	to	the	bridge.	“I	had	a	few	minutes,	so	I	ran	through	the
aerobrake	lockdown	checklist	for	the	reactor	room.

Everything's	ready	for	acceleration	and	the	compartment's	sealed	off.”

“Good	thinking,”	Lewis	said.	“Prep	the	attitude	correction.”

“Roger,	Commander.”	Martinez	said,	drifting	to	his	station.	“It'l	take	me	a	sec...	I
need	to	do	everything	backward.	The	VAL's	in

front,	so	the	source	of	thrust	wil	be	exactly	opposite	to	our	engines.	Our	software
wasn't	expecting	us	to	have	an	engine	there.	I	just	need	to	tel	it	we	plan	to	thrust
toward	Mark.”

“Take	your	time	and	get	it	right,”	Lewis	said.	“And	don't	execute	til	I	give	you
the	word.	We're	not	spinning	the	ship	around	while

Beck's	out	on	the	hul.”

“Roger.”	He	said.	After	a	moment,	he	added	“Ok,	the	adjustment's	ready	to
execute.”

“Standby.”	Lewis	said.

Vogel,	back	in	his	suit,	depressurized	Airlock	2	and	opened	the	outer	door.

“Bout	time,”	Beck	said,	climbing	in.

“Sorry	for	the	delay,”	Vogel	said.	“I	was	required	to	make	a	bomb.”

“This	has	been	kind	of	a	weird	day,”	Beck	said.	“Commander,	Vogel	and	I	are	in
position.”

“Copy,”	came	Lewis's	response.	“Get	up	against	the	fore	wal	of	the	airlock.	It's
going	to	be	about	one	g	for	four	seconds.	Make	sure

you're	both	tethered	in.”

“Copy,”	Beck	said	as	he	attached	his	tether.	The	two	men	pressed	themselves
against	the	wal.

“Ok,	Martinez,”	Lewis	said,	“Point	us	the	right	direction.”

“Copy,”	said	Martinez,	executing	the	attitude	adjustment.

Johanssen	floated	in	to	the	bridge	as	the	adjustment	was	performed.	The	room
rotated	around	her	as	she	reached	for	a	handhold.	“The

bomb's	ready,	and	the	breaker's	jammed	closed,”	she	said.	“I	can	set	it	off	by
remotely	turning	on	Lighting	Panel	41.”

“Seal	the	bridge	and	get	to	your	station,”	Lewis	said.

“Copy,”	Johanssen	said.	Unstowing	the	emergency	seal,	she	plugged	the
entrance	to	the	bridge.	With	a	few	turns	of	the	crank,	the	job

was	done.	She	returned	to	her	station	and	ran	a	quick	test.	“Increasing	Bridge
pressure	to	1.03	atmospheres...	pressure	is	steady	we	have	a	good	seal.”

“Copy,”	Lewis	said.	“Time	to	intercept?”

“28	seconds,”	Johanssen	said.

“Wow,”	Martinez	said.	“We	cut	that	pretty	close.”

“You	ready,	Johanssen?”	Lewis	asked.

“Yes,”	Johanssen	said.	“Al	I	have	to	do	is	hit	enter.”

“Martinez,	how's	our	angle?”

“Dead-on,	Commander,”	Martinez	reported.

“Strap	in,”	Lewis	said.

The	three	of	them	tightened	the	restraints	of	their	chairs.

“20	seconds,”	Johanssen	said.

Teddy	took	his	seat	in	the	VIP	room.	“What's	the	status?”	He	asked.

“15	seconds	til	they	blow	the	VAL,”	Venkat	said.	“Where	have	you	been?”

“On	the	phone	with	the	President,”	Teddy	said.	“Do	you	think	this	wil	work?”

“I	have	no	idea,”	Venkat	said.	“I've	never	felt	this	helpless	in	my	life.”

“If	it's	any	consolation,”	Teddy	said,	“Pretty	much	everyone	in	the	world	feels
the	same	way.”

On	the	other	side	of	the	glass,	Mitch	paced	to	and	fro.

“5...	4...	3...”	Johanssen	said.

“Brace	for	acceleration,”	Lewis	said.

“2...	1...”	Johanssen	continued.	“Activating	Panel	41.”

She	pressed	enter.

Inside	Vogel's	bomb,	the	ful	current	of	the	ship's	internal	lighting	system	flowed
through	a	thin,	exposed	wire.	It	quickly	reached	the

ignition	temperature	of	the	sugar.	What	would	have	been	a	minor	fizzle	in
Earth's	atmosphere	became	an	uncontroled	conflagration	in	the

container's	pure	oxygen	environment.	In	under	100	miliseconds,	the	massive
combustion	pressure	burst	the	container	and	the	resulting

explosion	ripped	the	airlock	door	to	shreds.

The	internal	air	of	Hermes	rushed	through	the	open	VAL,	blasting	Hermes	in	the
other	direction.

Vogel	and	Beck	were	pressed	against	the	wal	of	Airlock	2.	Lewis,	Martinez,	and
Johanssen	endured	the	acceleration	in	their	seats.	It

was	not	a	dangerous	amount	of	force,	in	fact	it	was	less	than	the	force	of	Earth's

surface	gravity.	But	it	was	inconsistent	and	jerky.

After	four	seconds,	the	shaking	died	down	and	the	ship	returned	to
weightlessness.

“Reactor	room	stil	pressurized,”	Martinez	reported.

“Bridge	seal	holding,”	Johanssen	said.	“Obviously.”

“Damage?”	Martinez	said.

“Not	sure	yet,”	Johanssen	said.	“I	have	External	Camera	four	pointed	along	the
nose.	I	don't	see	any	problems	with	the	hul	near	the

VAL.”

“Worry	about	that	later,”	Lewis	said.	“What's	our	relative	velocity	and	distance
to	MAV?”

Johanssen	typed	quickly.	“We'l	get	within	22	meters	and	we're	at	12	meters	per
second.	We	actualy	got	better	than	expected	thrust.”

“Watney,”	Lewis	said.	“It	worked.	Beck's	on	his	way.”

“Score!”	Watney	responded.

“Beck,”	Lewis	said.	“You're	up.	12	meters	per	second.”

“Close	enough!”	Beck	replied.

“I'm	going	to	jump	out,”	Beck	said.	“Should	get	me	another	two	or	three	meters
per	second.”

“Understood,”	Vogel	said,	loosely	gripping	Beck's	tether.	“Good	luck,	Dr.	Beck.”

Placing	his	feet	on	the	back	wal,	Beck	coiled	and	leaped	out	of	the	airlock.

Once	free,	he	got	his	bearings.	A	quick	look	to	his	right	showed	him	what	he
could	not	see	from	inside	the	airlock.

“I	have	visual!”	he	said.	“I	can	see	MAV!	Jesus,	Mark,	what	did	you	do	to	that

thing?”

“You	should	see	what	I	did	to	the	rover,”	Watney	radioed	back.

Beck	thrusted	on	an	intercept	course.	He	had	practiced	this	many	times.	The
presumption	in	those	practice	sessions	was	that	he'd	be

rescuing	a	crewmate	whose	tether	had	broken,	but	the	principle	was	the	same.

“Johanssen,”	he	said,	“You	got	me	on	radar?”

“Affirmative,”	she	replied.

“Cal	out	my	relative	velocity	to	Mark	every	2	seconds	or	so.”

“Copy.	5.2	meters	per	second.”

“Hey	Beck,”	Watney	said.	“The	front's	wide	open.	I'l	get	up	there	and	be	ready
to	grab	at	you.”

“Negative,”	interrupted	Lewis.	“No	untethered	movement.	Stay	strapped	to	your
chair	until	you're	latched	to	Beck.”

“Copy,”	Watney	said.

“3.1	meters	per	second,”	Johanssen	reported.

“Going	to	coast	for	a	bit,”	Beck	said.	“Gotta	catch	up	before	I	slow	it	down.”	He
rotated	himself	in	preparation	for	the	next	burn.

“11	meters	to	target,”	Johanssen	said.

“Copy.”

“6	meters,”	Johanssen	said.

“Aaaaand,	counter-thrusting.”	Beck	said,	firing	the	MMU	thrusters	again.	The
MAV	loomed	before	him.	“Velocity?”	He	asked.

“1.1	meters	per	second,”	Johanssen	said.

“Good	enough,”	he	said,	reaching	for	the	ship.	“I'm	drifting	toward	it.	I	think	I
can	get	my	hand	on	some	of	the	torn	canvas...”

The	tattered	canvas	beckoned	as	the	only	handhold	on	the	otherwise	smooth
ship.	Beck	reached,	extending	as	best	he	could,	and

managed	to	grab	hold.

“Contact,”	Beck	said.	Firming	his	grip,	he	puled	his	body	forward	and	lashed	out
with	his	other	hand	to	grab	more	canvas.	“Firm

contact!”

“Dr.	Beck,”	Vogel	said.	“We	have	past	closest	approach	point	and	you	are	now
getting	further	away.	You	have	169	meters	of	tether

left.	Enough	for	14	seconds.”

“Copy,”	Beck	said.

Puling	his	head	to	the	opening,	he	looked	inside	the	compartment	to	see	Watney
strapped	to	his	chair.

“Visual	on	Watney!”	He	reported.

“Visual	on	Beck!”	Watney	reported.

“How	ya	doin',	man?”	Beck	said,	puling	himself	in	to	the	ship.

“I...	I	just...”	Watney	said.	“Give	me	a	minute.	You're	the	first	person	I've	seen	in
18	months.”

“We	don't	have	a	minute,”	Beck	said,	kicking	off	the	wal.	“We've	got	11	seconds
before	we	run	out	of	tether.”

Beck's	course	took	him	to	the	chair	where	he	clumsily	colided	with	Watney.	The
two	gripped	each	others'	arms	to	keep	Beck	from

bouncing	away.	“Contact	with	Watney!”	Beck	said.

“8	seconds,	Dr.	Beck,”	Vogel	radioed.

“Copy,”	Beck	said	as	he	hastily	latched	the	front	of	his	suit	to	the	front	of
Watney's	with	tether	clips.	“Connected,”	he	said.

Watney	released	the	straps	on	his	chair.	“Restraints	off.”

“We're	outa'	here,”	Beck	said,	kicking	off	the	chair	toward	the	opening.

The	two	men	floated	across	the	MAV	cabin	to	the	opening.	Beck	reached	out	his
arm	and	pushed	off	the	edge	as	they	passed	through.

“We're	out,”	Beck	reported.

“5	seconds,”	Vogel	said.

“Relative	velocity	to	Hermes:	12	meters	per	second,”	Johanssen	said.

“Thrusting,”	Beck	said,	activating	his	MMU.

The	two	accelerated	toward	Hermes	for	a	few	seconds.	Then	the	MMU	controls
on	Beck's	heads-up	display	turned	red.

“That's	it	for	the	fuel,”	Beck	said.	“Velocity?”

“5	meters	per	second,”	Johanssen	replied.

“Standby,”	Vogel	said.	Throughout	the	process,	he	had	been	feeding	tether	out	of
the	airlock.	Now	he	gripped	the	ever-shrinking

remainder	of	the	rope	with	both	hands.	He	didn't	clamp	down	on	it;	that	would
pul	him	out	of	the	airlock.	He	simply	closed	his	hands	over	the	tether	to	create
friction.

Hermes	puled	Beck	and	Watney	along,	with	Vogel's	use	of	the	tether	acting	as	a
shock	absorber.	If	Vogel	used	too	much	force	the

shock	of	it	would	pul	the	tether	free	from	Beck's	suit	clips.	If	he	used	too	little
the	tether	would	run	out	before	they	matched	speeds,	then	it	would	have	a	hard
stop	at	the	end,	which	would	also	rip	it	out	of	Beck's	suit	clips.

Vogel	managed	to	find	the	balance.	After	a	few	seconds	of	tense,	gut-feel
physics,	Vogel	felt	the	force	on	the	tether	abate.

“Velocity	0!”	Johanssen	reported	excitedly.

“Reel	'em	in,	Vogel,”	Lewis	said.

“Copy,”	Vogel	said.	Hand	over	hand,	he	slowly	puled	his	crewmates	toward	the
airlock.	After	a	few	seconds,	he	stopped	actively

puling	and	simply	took	in	the	line	as	they	coasted	toward	him.

They	floated	in	to	the	airlock,	and	Vogel	grabbed	them.	Beck	and	Watney	both
reached	for	handholds	on	the	wal	as	Vogel	worked	his

way	around	them	and	closed	the	outer	door.

“Aboard!”	Beck	said.

“Airlock	2	outer	door	closed,”	Vogel	said.

“Yes!”	Martinez	yeled.

“Copy,”	Lewis	said.

Lewis's	voice	echoed	across	the	world:	“Houston,	this	is	Hermes	Actual.	Six
crew	safely	aboard.”

The	control	room	exploded	with	applause.	Leaping	from	their	seats,	they
cheered,	hugged,	and	cried.	The	same	scene	played	out	al

over	the	world	in	parks,	bars,	civic	centers,	living	rooms,	classrooms,	and
offices.

Mitch	haggardly	puled	off	his	headset	and	turned	to	face	the	VIP	room.	Through
the	glass,	he	saw	various	wel-suited	men	and	women

cheering	wildly.	He	looked	at	Venkat	and	let	out	a	heavy	sigh	of	relief.

Venkat	put	his	head	in	his	hands	and	whispered	“Thank	the	gods.”

Teddy	puled	a	blue	folder	from	his	briefcase	and	stood.	“Annie	wil	be	wanting
me	in	the	press	room.”

“Guess	you	don't	need	the	red	folder	today,”	Venkat	said.

“Honestly,	I	didn't	make	one.”	As	he	walked	out	he	added	“Good	work,	Venk.
Now	get	them	home.”

LOG	ENTRY:	MISSION	DAY	687

That	“687”	caught	me	off	guard	for	a	minute.	On	Hermes,	we	track	time	by
mission	days.	It	may	be	Sol	549	down	on	Mars,	but	it's

Mission	Day	687	up	here.	And	you	know	what?	It	doesn't	matter	what	time	it	is
on	Mars	cause	I'M	NOT	FUCKING	THERE!

Oh	my	god.	I'm	realy	not	on	Mars	anymore.	I	can	tel	because	there's	no	gravity
and	there	are	other	humans	around.	I'm	stil	adjusting.

If	this	were	a	movie,	everyone	would	have	been	in	the	airlock	and	there	would
have	been	high-fives	al	around.	But	it	didn't	pan	out	that	way.

I	broke	two	ribs	during	the	MAV	ascent.	They	were	sore	the	whole	time,	but	they
realy	started	screaming	when	Vogel	puled	us	in	to

the	airlock	by	the	tether.	I	didn't	want	to	distract	the	people	who	were	saving	my
life	so	I	muted	off	my	mic	and	screamed	like	a	little	girl.

It's	true,	you	know.	In	space,	no	one	can	hear	you	scream	like	a	little	girl.

Once	they	got	me	in	to	Airlock	2,	they	opened	the	inner	door	and	I	was	finaly
aboard	again.	Hermes	was	stil	in	vacuo,	so	we	didn't

have	to	cycle	the	airlock.

Beck	told	me	to	go	limp	and	pushed	me	down	the	corridor	toward	his	quarters
(which	serve	as	the	ship's	“sick	bay”	when	needed).

Vogel	went	the	other	direction	and	closed	the	outer	VAL	door.

Once	Beck	and	I	got	to	his	quarters,	we	waited	for	the	ship	to	repressurize.
Hermes	had	enough	spare	air	to	refil	the	ship	two	more

times	if	needed.	It'd	be	a	pretty	shitty	long-range	ship	if	it	couldn't	recover	from

a	decompression.

Once	Johanssen	gave	us	the	al	clear,	Dr.	Bossy-Beck	made	me	wait	while	he	first
took	off	his	suit,	then	took	off	mine.	After	he	puled

my	helmet	off,	he	looked	shocked.	I	thought	maybe	I	had	a	major	head-wound	or
something,	but	it	turns	out	it	was	the	smel.

It's	been	a	while	since	I	washed...	anything.

After	that,	it	was	x-rays	and	chest	bandages	while	the	rest	of	the	crew	waited
outside.

Then	came	the	(painful)	high-fives,	folowed	by	people	staying	as	far	away	from
my	stench	as	possible.	We	had	a	few	minutes	of

reunion	before	Beck	shuttled	everyone	out.	He	gave	me	painkilers	and	told	me	to
shower	as	soon	as	I	could	freely	move	my	arms.

So	now	I'm	waiting	for	the	drugs	to	kick	in.	My	ribs	hurt	like	hel,	my	vision	is
stil	blurry	from	acceleration	sickness,	I'm	realy	hungry,	it'l	be	another	211	days
before	I'm	back	on	Earth,	and	apparently	I	smel	like	a	skunk	took	a	shit	on	some
sweat	socks.

This	is	the	happiest	day	of	my	life.

Watney	finished	his	two	slices	of	pizza	and	a	coke.	He	had	another	half-hour	to
kil	before	going	back	to	Johnson	Space	Center.

Leaving	the	pizzeria,	he	sat	on	a	public	bench	just	outside.

Next	week	would	be	busy.	He	would	be	meeting	the	Ares-6	Engineer.	He	had
read	her	file,	but	had	never	met	her	in	person.	He

wouldn't	get	much	time	to	relax	after	that.	The	folowing	six	weeks	would	be
filed	with	constant	training	as	he	tried	to	impart	as	much

knowledge	as	he	could.

But	that	was	something	to	worry	about	later.	Right	now,	he	took	a	deep	breath	of

the	fresh	air	and	watched	the	people	go	by.

“Hey,	I	know	you!”	Came	a	voice	from	behind.

A	young	boy	had	strayed	from	his	mother.	“You're	Mark	Watney!”

“Sweetie,”	the	boy's	mom	said,	embarrassed.	“Don't	bother	people	like	that.”

“It's	ok,”	Watney	shrugged.

“You	went	to	Mars!”	The	boy	said,	his	eyes	wide	with	awe.

“Sure	did,”	Watney	said.	“Almost	didn't	make	it	back.”

“I	know!”	Said	the	boy.	“That	was	awesome!”

“Sweetie!”	The	mom	scolded.	“That's	rude.”

“So	Mr.	Watney,”	the	boy	said,	“If	you	could	go	to	Mars	again,	like,	if	there	was
another	mission	and	they	wanted	you	to	go,	would

you	go?”

Watney	scowled	at	him.	“You	out	of	your	fucking	mind?”

“Ok	time	to	go,”	the	mom	said,	quickly	herding	the	boy	away.	They	receded	in
to	the	crowded	sidewalk.

Watney	snorted	in	their	direction.	Then	he	closed	his	eyes	and	felt	the	sun	on	his
face.	It	was	a	nice,	boring	afternoon.
